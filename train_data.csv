albert einstein,"
albert einstein ( ; ; 14 march 1879â â 18 april 1955) was a german-born theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics (alongside quantum mechanics). his work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. he is best known to the general public for his massâenergy equivalence formula formula_1, which has been dubbed ""the world's most famous equation"". he received the 1921 nobel prize in physics ""for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect"", a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory.

near the beginning of his career, einstein thought that newtonian mechanics was no longer enough to reconcile the laws of classical mechanics with the laws of the electromagnetic field. this led him to develop his special theory of relativity during his time at the swiss patent office in bern (1902â1909). he subsequently realized that the principle of relativity could be extended to gravitational fields, and published a paper on general relativity in 1916 introducing his theory of gravitation. he continued to deal with problems of statistical mechanics and quantum theory, which led to his explanations of particle theory and the motion of molecules. he also investigated the thermal properties of light which laid the foundation of the photon theory of light. in 1917, he applied the general theory of relativity to model the structure of the universe.

einstein moved to switzerland in 1895 and renounced his german citizenship in 1896. after being stateless for more than five years, he acquired swiss citizenship in 1901, which he kept for the rest of his life. except for one year in prague, he lived in switzerland between 1895 and 1914.

he received his academic diploma from the swiss federal polytechnic school (later the eidgenã¶ssische technische hochschule, eth) in zã¼rich in 1900. between 1902 and 1909 he was employed in bern as a patent examiner at the federal office for intellectual property, the patent office. in 1905, called his ""annus mirabilis"" (miracle year), he published four groundbreaking papers, which attracted the attention of the academic world. that year, at the age of 26, he was awarded a phd by the university of zurich.

he taught theoretical physics for one year (1908/09) at the university of bern, for two years (1909-11) at the university of zurich, and after one year at the charles university in prague he returned to his alma mater eth zurich between 1912 and 1914, before he left for berlin, where he was elected to the prussian academy of sciences.

in 1933, while einstein was visiting the united states, adolf hitler came to power. because of his jewish background, einstein did not return to germany. he settled in the united states and became an american citizen in 1940. on the eve of world war ii, he endorsed a letter to president franklin d. roosevelt alerting fdr to the potential development of ""extremely powerful bombs of a new type"" and recommending that the us begin similar research. this eventually led to the manhattan project. einstein supported the allies, but he generally denounced the idea of using nuclear fission as a weapon. he signed the russellâeinstein manifesto with british philosopher bertrand russell, which highlighted the danger of nuclear weapons. he was affiliated with the institute for advanced study in princeton, new jersey, until his death in 1955.

he published more than 300 scientific papers and more than 150 non-scientific works. his intellectual achievements and originality have made the word ""einstein"" synonymous with ""genius"". eugene wigner compared him to his contemporaries, writing that ""einstein's understanding was deeper even than jancsi von neumann's. his mind was both more penetrating and more original"".

albert einstein was born in ulm, in the kingdom of wã¼rttemberg in the german empire, on 14 march 1879. his parents were hermann einstein, a salesman and engineer, and pauline koch. in 1880, the family moved to munich, where einstein's father and his uncle jakob founded ""elektrotechnische fabrik j. einstein & cie"", a company that manufactured electrical equipment based on direct current.

the einsteins were non-observant ashkenazi jews, and albert attended a catholic elementary school in munich, from the age of 5, for three years. at the age of 8, he was transferred to the luitpold gymnasium (now known as the albert einstein gymnasium), where he received advanced primary and secondary school education until he left the german empire seven years later.

in 1894, hermann and jakob's company lost a bid to supply the city of munich with electrical lighting because they lacked the capital to convert their equipment from the direct current (dc) standard to the more efficient alternating current (ac) standard. the loss forced the sale of the munich factory. in search of business, the einstein family moved to italy, first to milan and a few months later to pavia. when the family moved to pavia, einstein, then 15, stayed in munich to finish his studies at the luitpold gymnasium. his father intended for him to pursue electrical engineering, but einstein clashed with authorities and resented the school's regimen and teaching method. he later wrote that the spirit of learning and creative thought was lost in strict rote learning. at the end of december 1894, he travelled to italy to join his family in pavia, convincing the school to let him go by using a doctor's note. during his time in italy he wrote a short essay with the title ""on the investigation of the state of the ether in a magnetic field"".

einstein always excelled at math and physics from a young age, reaching a mathematical level years ahead of his peers. the twelve-year-old einstein taught himself algebra and euclidean geometry over a single summer. einstein also independently discovered his own original proof of the pythagorean theorem at age 12. a family tutor max talmud says that after he had given the 12-year-old einstein a geometry textbook, after a short time ""[einstein] had worked through the whole book. he thereupon devoted himself to higher mathematics... soon the flight of his mathematical genius was so high i could not follow."" his passion for geometry and algebra led the twelve-year-old to become convinced that nature could be understood as a ""mathematical structure"". einstein started teaching himself calculus at 12, and as a 14-year-old he says he had ""mastered integral and differential calculus"".

at age 13, einstein was introduced to kant's ""critique of pure reason"", and kant became his favorite philosopher, his tutor stating: ""at the time he was still a child, only thirteen years old, yet kant's works, incomprehensible to ordinary mortals, seemed to be clear to him.""

in 1895, at the age of 16, einstein took the entrance examinations for the swiss federal polytechnic in zã¼rich (later the eidgenã¶ssische technische hochschule, eth). he failed to reach the required standard in the general part of the examination, but obtained exceptional grades in physics and mathematics. on the advice of the principal of the polytechnic, he attended the argovian cantonal school (gymnasium) in aarau, switzerland, in 1895 and 1896 to complete his secondary schooling. while lodging with the family of professor jost winteler, he fell in love with winteler's daughter, marie. albert's sister maja later married winteler's son paul. in january 1896, with his father's approval, einstein renounced his citizenship in the german kingdom of wã¼rttemberg to avoid military service. in september 1896, he passed the swiss matura with mostly good grades, including a top grade of 6 in physics and mathematical subjects, on a scale of 1â6. at 17, he enrolled in the four-year mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the zã¼rich polytechnic. marie winteler, who was a year older, moved to olsberg, switzerland, for a teaching post.

einstein's future wife, a 20-year-old serbian woman mileva mariä, also enrolled at the polytechnic that year. she was the only woman among the six students in the mathematics and physics section of the teaching diploma course. over the next few years, einstein's and mariä's friendship developed into romance, and they read books together on extra-curricular physics in which einstein was taking an increasing interest. in 1900, einstein passed the exams in maths and physics and was awarded the federal polytechnic teaching diploma. there have been claims that mariä collaborated with einstein on his 1905 papers, known as the ""annus mirabilis"" papers, but historians of physics who have studied the issue find no evidence that she made any substantive contributions.

an early correspondence between einstein and mariä was discovered and published in 1987 which revealed that the couple had a daughter named ""lieserl"", born in early 1902 in novi sad where mariä was staying with her parents. mariä returned to switzerland without the child, whose real name and fate are unknown. the contents of einstein's letter in september 1903 suggest that the girl was either given up for adoption or died of scarlet fever in infancy.
einstein and mariä married in january 1903. in may 1904, their son hans albert einstein was born in bern, switzerland. their son eduard was born in zã¼rich in july 1910. the couple moved to berlin in april 1914, but mariä returned to zã¼rich with their sons after learning that einstein's chief romantic attraction was his first and second cousin elsa. they divorced on 14 february 1919, having lived apart for five years. eduard had a breakdown at about age 20 and was diagnosed with schizophrenia. his mother cared for him and he was also committed to asylums for several periods, finally being committed permanently after her death.

in letters revealed in 2015, einstein wrote to his early love marie winteler about his marriage and his strong feelings for her. he wrote in 1910, while his wife was pregnant with their second child: ""i think of you in heartfelt love every spare minute and am so unhappy as only a man can be."" he spoke about a ""misguided love"" and a ""missed life"" regarding his love for marie.

einstein married elsa lã¶wenthal in 1919, after having a relationship with her since 1912. she was a first cousin maternally and a second cousin paternally. they emigrated to the united states in 1933. elsa was diagnosed with heart and kidney problems in 1935 and died in december 1936.

among einstein's well-known friends were michele besso, paul ehrenfest, marcel grossmann, jã¡nos plesch, daniel q. posin, maurice solovine, and stephen wise.

after graduating in 1900, einstein spent almost two frustrating years searching for a teaching post. he acquired swiss citizenship in february 1901, but for medical reasons was not conscripted. with the help of marcel grossmann's father, he secured a job in bern at the federal office for intellectual property, the patent office, as an assistant examiner â level iii.

einstein evaluated patent applications for a variety of devices including a gravel sorter and an electromechanical typewriter. in 1903, his position at the swiss patent office became permanent, although he was passed over for promotion until he ""fully mastered machine technology"".

much of his work at the patent office related to questions about transmission of electric signals and electricalâmechanical synchronization of time, two technical problems that show up conspicuously in the thought experiments that eventually led einstein to his radical conclusions about the nature of light and the fundamental connection between space and time.

with a few friends he had met in bern, einstein started a small discussion group in 1902, self-mockingly named ""the olympia academy"", which met regularly to discuss science and philosophy. their readings included the works of henri poincarã©, ernst mach, and david hume, which influenced his scientific and philosophical outlook.

in 1900, einstein's paper ""folgerungen aus den capillaritã¤tserscheinungen"" (""conclusions from the capillarity phenomena"") was published in the journal ""annalen der physik"". on 30 april 1905, einstein completed his thesis, with alfred kleiner, professor of experimental physics, serving as ""pro-forma"" advisor. as a result, einstein was awarded a phd by the university of zã¼rich, with his dissertation ""a new determination of molecular dimensions"".

in that same year, which has been called einstein's ""annus mirabilis"" (miracle year), he published four groundbreaking papers, on the photoelectric effect, brownian motion, special relativity, and the equivalence of mass and energy, which were to bring him to the notice of the academic world, at the age of 26.

by 1908, he was recognized as a leading scientist and was appointed lecturer at the university of bern. the following year, after giving a lecture on electrodynamics and the relativity principle at the university of zã¼rich, alfred kleiner recommended him to the faculty for a newly created professorship in theoretical physics. einstein was appointed associate professor in 1909.

einstein became a full professor at the german charles-ferdinand university in prague in april 1911, accepting austrian citizenship in the austro-hungarian empire to do so. during his prague stay, he wrote 11 scientific works, five of them on radiation mathematics and on the quantum theory of solids. in july 1912, he returned to his alma mater in zã¼rich. from 1912 until 1914, he was professor of theoretical physics at the eth zurich, where he taught analytical mechanics and thermodynamics. he also studied continuum mechanics, the molecular theory of heat, and the problem of gravitation, on which he worked with mathematician and friend marcel grossmann.
on 3 july 1913, he was voted for membership in the prussian academy of sciences in berlin. max planck and walther nernst visited him the next week in zurich to persuade him to join the academy, additionally offering him the post of director at the kaiser wilhelm institute for physics, which was soon to be established. (membership in the academy included paid salary and professorship without teaching duties at the humboldt university of berlin.) he was officially elected to the academy on 24 july, and he accepted to move to the german empire the next year. his decision to move to berlin was also influenced by the prospect of living near his cousin elsa, with whom he had developed a romantic affair. he joined the academy and thus the berlin university on 1 april 1914. as world war i broke out that year, the plan for kaiser wilhelm institute for physics was aborted. the institute was established on 1 october 1917, with einstein as its director. in 1916, einstein was elected president of the german physical society (1916â1918).

based on calculations einstein made in 1911, about his new theory of general relativity, light from another star should be bent by the sun's gravity. in 1919, that prediction was confirmed by sir arthur eddington during the solar eclipse of 29 may 1919. those observations were published in the international media, making einstein world-famous. on 7 november 1919, the leading british newspaper ""the times"" printed a banner headline that read: ""revolution in scienceâ â new theory of the universeâ â newtonian ideas overthrown"".

in 1920, he became a foreign member of the royal netherlands academy of arts and sciences. in 1922, he was awarded the 1921 nobel prize in physics ""for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect"". while the general theory of relativity was still considered somewhat controversial, the citation also does not treat even the cited photoelectric work as an ""explanation"" but merely as a ""discovery of the law"", as the idea of photons was considered outlandish and did not receive universal acceptance until the 1924 derivation of the planck spectrum by s. n. bose. einstein was elected a foreign member of the royal society (formemrs) in 1921. he also received the copley medal from the royal society in 1925.

einstein visited new york city for the first time on 2 april 1921, where he received an official welcome by mayor john francis hylan, followed by three weeks of lectures and receptions. he went on to deliver several lectures at columbia university and princeton university, and in washington he accompanied representatives of the national academy of science on a visit to the white house. on his return to europe he was the guest of the british statesman and philosopher viscount haldane in london, where he met several renowned scientific, intellectual and political figures, and delivered a lecture at king's college london. 

he also published an essay, ""my first impression of the u.s.a."", in july 1921, in which he tried briefly to describe some characteristics of americans, much as had alexis de tocqueville, who published his own impressions in ""democracy in america"" (1835). for some of his observations, einstein was clearly surprised: ""what strikes a visitor is the joyous, positive attitude to life ... the american is friendly, self-confident, optimistic, and without envy.""

in 1922, his travels took him to asia and later to palestine, as part of a six-month excursion and speaking tour, as he visited singapore, ceylon and japan, where he gave a series of lectures to thousands of japanese. after his first public lecture, he met the emperor and empress at the imperial palace, where thousands came to watch. in a letter to his sons, he described his impression of the japanese as being modest, intelligent, considerate, and having a true feel for art. in his own travel diaries from his 1922â23 visit to asia, he expresses some views on the chinese, japanese and indian people, which have been described as xenophobic and racist judgments when they were rediscovered in 2018.

because of einstein's travels to the far east, he was unable to personally accept the nobel prize for physics at the stockholm award ceremony in december 1922. in his place, the banquet speech was held by a german diplomat, who praised einstein not only as a scientist but also as an international peacemaker and activist.

on his return voyage, he visited palestine for 12 days in what would become his only visit to that region. he was greeted as if he were a head of state, rather than a physicist, which included a cannon salute upon arriving at the home of the british high commissioner, sir herbert samuel. during one reception, the building was stormed by people who wanted to see and hear him. in einstein's talk to the audience, he expressed happiness that the jewish people were beginning to be recognized as a force in the world.

einstein visited spain for two weeks in 1923, where he briefly met santiago ramã³n y cajal and also received a diploma from king alfonso xiii naming him a member of the spanish academy of sciences.

from 1922 to 1932, einstein was a member of the international committee on intellectual cooperation of the league of nations in geneva (with a few months of interruption in 1923â1924), a body created to promote international exchange between scientists, researchers, teachers, artists and intellectuals. originally slated to serve as the swiss delegate, secretary-general eric drummond was persuaded by catholic activists oskar halecki and giuseppe motta to instead have him become the german delegate, thus allowing gonzague de reynold to take the swiss spot, from which he promoted traditionalist catholic values. einsteinâs former physics professor hendrik lorentz and the french chemist marie curie were also members of the committee.

in december 1930, einstein visited america for the second time, originally intended as a two-month working visit as a research fellow at the california institute of technology. after the national attention he received during his first trip to the us, he and his arrangers aimed to protect his privacy. although swamped with telegrams and invitations to receive awards or speak publicly, he declined them all.

after arriving in new york city, einstein was taken to various places and events, including chinatown, a lunch with the editors of ""the new york times"", and a performance of ""carmen"" at the metropolitan opera, where he was cheered by the audience on his arrival. during the days following, he was given the keys to the city by mayor jimmy walker and met the president of columbia university, who described einstein as ""the ruling monarch of the mind"". harry emerson fosdick, pastor at new york's riverside church, gave einstein a tour of the church and showed him a full-size statue that the church made of einstein, standing at the entrance. also during his stay in new york, he joined a crowd of 15,000 people at madison square garden during a hanukkah celebration.
einstein next traveled to california, where he met caltech president and nobel laureate, robert a. millikan. his friendship with millikan was ""awkward"", as millikan ""had a penchant for patriotic militarism"", where einstein was a pronounced pacifist. during an address to caltech's students, einstein noted that science was often inclined to do more harm than good.

this aversion to war also led einstein to befriend author upton sinclair and film star charlie chaplin, both noted for their pacifism. carl laemmle, head of universal studios, gave einstein a tour of his studio and introduced him to chaplin. they had an instant rapport, with chaplin inviting einstein and his wife, elsa, to his home for dinner. chaplin said einstein's outward persona, calm and gentle, seemed to conceal a ""highly emotional temperament"", from which came his ""extraordinary intellectual energy"".

chaplin's film, ""city lights"", was to premiere a few days later in hollywood, and chaplin invited einstein and elsa to join him as his special guests. walter isaacson, einstein's biographer, described this as ""one of the most memorable scenes in the new era of celebrity"". chaplin visited einstein at his home on a later trip to berlin, and recalled his ""modest little flat"" and the piano at which he had begun writing his theory. chaplin speculated that it was ""possibly used as kindling wood by the nazis"".

in february 1933, while on a visit to the united states, einstein knew he could not return to germany with the rise to power of the nazis under germany's new chancellor, adolf hitler.

while at american universities in early 1933, he undertook his third two-month visiting professorship at the california institute of technology in pasadena. he and his wife elsa returned to europe in march, and during the trip they learned that the german reichstag passed the enabling act, which transformed hitler's government into a de facto legal dictatorship and that they would not be able to proceed to berlin. later on they heard that their cottage was raided by the nazis and his personal sailboat confiscated. upon landing in antwerp, belgium on 28 march, he immediately went to the german consulate and surrendered his passport, formally renouncing his german citizenship. the nazis later sold his boat and converted his cottage into a hitler youth camp.
after staying some days at castle cantecroy in mortsel, a villa was rented in de haan on the belgian coast for half a year. on 9 september, they took the ferry to dover, and arrived in the us on 17 october.

in april 1933, einstein discovered that the new german government had passed laws barring jews from holding any official positions, including teaching at universities. historian gerald holton describes how, with ""virtually no audible protest being raised by their colleagues"", thousands of jewish scientists were suddenly forced to give up their university positions and their names were removed from the rolls of institutions where they were employed.

a month later, einstein's works were among those targeted by the german student union in the nazi book burnings, with nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels proclaiming, ""jewish intellectualism is dead."" one german magazine included him in a list of enemies of the german regime with the phrase, ""not yet hanged"", offering a $5,000 bounty on his head. in a subsequent letter to physicist and friend max born, who had already emigrated from germany to england, einstein wrote, ""...â i must confess that the degree of their brutality and cowardice came as something of a surprise."" after moving to the us, he described the book burnings as a ""spontaneous emotional outburst"" by those who ""shun popular enlightenment"", and ""more than anything else in the world, fear the influence of men of intellectual independence"".

einstein was now without a permanent home, unsure where he would live and work, and equally worried about the fate of countless other scientists still in germany. he rented a house in de haan, belgium, where he lived for a few months. in late july 1933, he went to england for about six weeks at the personal invitation of british naval officer commander oliver locker-lampson, who had become friends with einstein in the preceding years. to protect einstein, locker-lampson had two assistants watch over him at his secluded cottage outside london, with a photo of them carrying shotguns and guarding einstein, published in the ""daily herald"" on 24 july 1933.

locker-lampson took einstein to meet winston churchill at his home, and later, austen chamberlain and former prime minister lloyd george. einstein asked them to help bring jewish scientists out of germany. british historian martin gilbert notes that churchill responded immediately, and sent his friend, physicist frederick lindemann, to germany to seek out jewish scientists and place them in british universities. churchill later observed that as a result of germany having driven the jews out, they had lowered their ""technical standards"" and put the allies' technology ahead of theirs.

einstein later contacted leaders of other nations, including turkey's prime minister, ä°smet ä°nã¶nã¼, to whom he wrote in september 1933 requesting placement of unemployed german-jewish scientists. as a result of einstein's letter, jewish invitees to turkey eventually totaled over ""1,000 saved individuals"".

locker-lampson also submitted a bill to parliament to extend british citizenship to einstein, during which period einstein made a number of public appearances describing the crisis brewing in europe. in one of his speeches he denounced germany's treatment of jews, while at the same time he introduced a bill promoting jewish citizenship in palestine, as they were being denied citizenship elsewhere. in his speech he described einstein as a ""citizen of the world"" who should be offered a temporary shelter in the uk. both bills failed, however, and einstein then accepted an earlier offer from the institute for advanced study, in princeton, new jersey, us, to become a resident scholar.

in october 1933, einstein returned to the us and took up a position at the institute for advanced study, noted for having become a refuge for scientists fleeing nazi germany. at the time, most american universities, including harvard, princeton and yale, had minimal or no jewish faculty or students, as a result of their jewish quotas, which lasted until the late 1940s.

einstein was still undecided on his future. he had offers from several european universities, including christ church, oxford where he stayed for three short periods between may 1931 and june 1933 and was offered a 5-year studentship, but in 1935, he arrived at the decision to remain permanently in the united states and apply for citizenship.

einstein's affiliation with the institute for advanced study would last until his death in 1955. he was one of the four first selected (two of the others being john von neumann and kurt gã¶del) at the new institute, where he soon developed a close friendship with gã¶del. the two would take long walks together discussing their work. bruria kaufman, his assistant, later became a physicist. during this period, einstein tried to develop a unified field theory and to refute the accepted interpretation of quantum physics, both unsuccessfully.

in 1939, a group of hungarian scientists that included ã©migrã© physicist leã³ szilã¡rd attempted to alert washington to ongoing nazi atomic bomb research. the group's warnings were discounted. einstein and szilã¡rd, along with other refugees such as edward teller and eugene wigner, ""regarded it as their responsibility to alert americans to the possibility that german scientists might win the race to build an atomic bomb, and to warn that hitler would be more than willing to resort to such a weapon."" to make certain the us was aware of the danger, in july 1939, a few months before the beginning of world war ii in europe, szilã¡rd and wigner visited einstein to explain the possibility of atomic bombs, which einstein, a pacifist, said he had never considered. he was asked to lend his support by writing a letter, with szilã¡rd, to president roosevelt, recommending the us pay attention and engage in its own nuclear weapons research.

the letter is believed to be ""arguably the key stimulus for the u.s. adoption of serious investigations into nuclear weapons on the eve of the u.s. entry into world war ii"". in addition to the letter, einstein used his connections with the belgian royal family and the belgian queen mother to get access with a personal envoy to the white house's oval office. some say that as a result of einstein's letter and his meetings with roosevelt, the us entered the ""race"" to develop the bomb, drawing on its ""immense material, financial, and scientific resources"" to initiate the manhattan project.

for einstein, ""war was a diseaseâ ... [and] he called for resistance to war."" by signing the letter to roosevelt, some argue he went against his pacifist principles. in 1954, a year before his death, einstein said to his old friend, linus pauling, ""i made one great mistake in my lifeâwhen i signed the letter to president roosevelt recommending that atom bombs be made; but there was some justificationâthe danger that the germans would make themâ ...""

einstein became an american citizen in 1940. not long after settling into his career at the institute for advanced study (in princeton, new jersey), he expressed his appreciation of the meritocracy in american culture when compared to europe. he recognized the ""right of individuals to say and think what they pleased"", without social barriers, and as a result, individuals were encouraged, he said, to be more creative, a trait he valued from his own early education.

einstein joined the national association for the advancement of colored people (naacp) in princeton, where he campaigned for the civil rights of african americans. he considered racism america's ""worst disease"", seeing it as ""handed down from one generation to the next"". as part of his involvement, he corresponded with civil rights activist w. e. b. du bois and was prepared to testify on his behalf during his trial in 1951. when einstein offered to be a character witness for du bois, the judge decided to drop the case.

in 1946 einstein visited lincoln university in pennsylvania, a historically black college, where he was awarded an honorary degree. (lincoln was the first university in the united states to grant college degrees to african americans; alumni include langston hughes and thurgood marshall.) einstein gave a speech about racism in america, adding, ""i do not intend to be quiet about it."" a resident of princeton recalls that einstein had once paid the college tuition for a black student.

einstein was a figurehead leader in helping establish the hebrew university of jerusalem, which opened in 1925, and was among its first board of governors. earlier, in 1921, he was asked by the biochemist and president of the world zionist organization, chaim weizmann, to help raise funds for the planned university. he also submitted various suggestions as to its initial programs.

among those, he advised first creating an institute of agriculture in order to settle the undeveloped land. that should be followed, he suggested, by a chemical institute and an institute of microbiology, to fight the various ongoing epidemics such as malaria, which he called an ""evil"" that was undermining a third of the country's development. establishing an oriental studies institute, to include language courses given in both hebrew and arabic, for scientific exploration of the country and its historical monuments, was also important.

chaim weizmann later became israel's first president. upon his death while in office in november 1952 and at the urging of ezriel carlebach, prime minister david ben-gurion offered einstein the position of president of israel, a mostly ceremonial post. the offer was presented by israel's ambassador in washington, abba eban, who explained that the offer ""embodies the deepest respect which the jewish people can repose in any of its sons"". einstein declined, and wrote in his response that he was ""deeply moved"", and ""at once saddened and ashamed"" that he could not accept it.

einstein developed an appreciation for music at an early age. in his late journals he wrote: ""if i were not a physicist, i would probably be a musician. i often think in music. i live my daydreams in music. i see my life in terms of music... i get most joy in life out of music.""

his mother played the piano reasonably well and wanted her son to learn the violin, not only to instill in him a love of music but also to help him assimilate into german culture. according to conductor leon botstein, einstein began playing when he was 5. however, he did not enjoy it at that age.

when he turned 13, he discovered the violin sonatas of mozart, whereupon he became enamored of mozart's compositions and studied music more willingly. einstein taught himself to play without ""ever practicing systematically"". he said that ""love is a better teacher than a sense of duty."" at age 17, he was heard by a school examiner in aarau while playing beethoven's violin sonatas. the examiner stated afterward that his playing was ""remarkable and revealing of 'great insight'"". what struck the examiner, writes botstein, was that einstein ""displayed a deep love of the music, a quality that was and remains in short supply. music possessed an unusual meaning for this student.""

music took on a pivotal and permanent role in einstein's life from that period on. although the idea of becoming a professional musician himself was not on his mind at any time, among those with whom einstein played chamber music were a few professionals, and he performed for private audiences and friends. chamber music had also become a regular part of his social life while living in bern, zã¼rich, and berlin, where he played with max planck and his son, among others. he is sometimes erroneously credited as the editor of the 1937 edition of the kã¶chel catalogue of mozart's work; that edition was prepared by alfred einstein, who may have been a distant relation.

in 1931, while engaged in research at the california institute of technology, he visited the zoellner family conservatory in los angeles, where he played some of beethoven and mozart's works with members of the zoellner quartet. near the end of his life, when the young juilliard quartet visited him in princeton, he played his violin with them, and the quartet was ""impressed by einstein's level of coordination and intonation"".

in 1918, einstein was one of the founding members of the german democratic party, a liberal party. however, later in his life, einstein's political view was in favor of socialism and critical of capitalism, which he detailed in his essays such as ""why socialism?"". einstein offered and was called on to give judgments and opinions on matters often unrelated to theoretical physics or mathematics. he strongly advocated the idea of a democratic global government that would check the power of nation-states in the framework of a world federation. the fbi created a secret dossier on einstein in 1932, and by the time of his death his fbi file was 1,427 pages long.

einstein was deeply impressed by mahatma gandhi. he exchanged written letters with gandhi, and called him ""a role model for the generations to come"" in a letter writing about him.

einstein spoke of his spiritual outlook in a wide array of original writings and interviews. einstein stated that he had sympathy for the impersonal pantheistic god of baruch spinoza's philosophy. he did not believe in a personal god who concerns himself with fates and actions of human beings, a view which he described as naã¯ve. he clarified, however, that ""i am not an atheist"", preferring to call himself an agnostic, or a ""deeply religious nonbeliever"". when asked if he believed in an afterlife, einstein replied, ""no. and one life is enough for me.""

einstein was primarily affiliated with non-religious humanist and ethical culture groups in both the uk and us. he served on the advisory board of the first humanist society of new york, and was an honorary associate of the rationalist association, which publishes ""new humanist"" in britain. for the seventy-fifth anniversary of the new york society for ethical culture, he stated that the idea of ethical culture embodied his personal conception of what is most valuable and enduring in religious idealism. he observed, ""without 'ethical culture' there is no salvation for humanity.""

in a one-and-a-half-page hand-written german-language letter to philosopher eric gutkind, dated princeton, 3 january 1954, fifteen months before his death, einstein wrote: ""the word god is for me nothing but the expression and product of human weaknesses, the bible a collection of venerable but still rather primitive legends. no interpretation, no matter how subtle, can (for me) change anything about this. [...] for me the jewish religion like all other religions is an incarnation of the most childish superstition. [...] i cannot see anything 'chosen' about them [the jewish people].""

on 17 april 1955, einstein experienced internal bleeding caused by the rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm, which had previously been reinforced surgically by rudolph nissen in 1948. he took the draft of a speech he was preparing for a television appearance commemorating the state of israel's seventh anniversary with him to the hospital, but he did not live long enough to complete it.

einstein refused surgery, saying, ""i want to go when i want. it is tasteless to prolong life artificially. i have done my share; it is time to go. i will do it elegantly."" he died in princeton hospital early the next morning at the age of 76, having continued to work until near the end.

during the autopsy, the pathologist of princeton hospital, thomas stoltz harvey, removed einstein's brain for preservation without the permission of his family, in the hope that the neuroscience of the future would be able to discover what made einstein so intelligent. einstein's remains were cremated and his ashes were scattered at an undisclosed location.

in a memorial lecture delivered on 13 december 1965, at unesco headquarters, nuclear physicist j. robert oppenheimer summarized his impression of einstein as a person: ""he was almost wholly without sophistication and wholly without worldlinessâ ... there was always with him a wonderful purity at once childlike and profoundly stubborn.""

throughout his life, einstein published hundreds of books and articles. he published more than 300 scientific papers and 150 non-scientific ones. on 5 december 2014, universities and archives announced the release of einstein's papers, comprising more than 30,000 unique documents. einstein's intellectual achievements and originality have made the word ""einstein"" synonymous with ""genius"". in addition to the work he did by himself he also collaborated with other scientists on additional projects including the boseâeinstein statistics, the einstein refrigerator and others.

the ""annus mirabilis"" papers are four articles pertaining to the photoelectric effect (which gave rise to quantum theory), brownian motion, the special theory of relativity, and e = mc that einstein published in the ""annalen der physik"" scientific journal in 1905. these four works contributed substantially to the foundation of modern physics and changed views on space, time, and matter. the four papers are:

einstein's first paper submitted in 1900 to ""annalen der physik"" was on capillary attraction. it was published in 1901 with the title ""folgerungen aus den capillaritã¤tserscheinungen"", which translates as ""conclusions from the capillarity phenomena"". two papers he published in 1902â1903 (thermodynamics) attempted to interpret atomic phenomena from a statistical point of view. these papers were the foundation for the 1905 paper on brownian motion, which showed that brownian movement can be construed as firm evidence that molecules exist. his research in 1903 and 1904 was mainly concerned with the effect of finite atomic size on diffusion phenomena.

einstein returned to the problem of thermodynamic fluctuations, giving a treatment of the density variations in a fluid at its critical point. ordinarily the density fluctuations are controlled by the second derivative of the free energy with respect to the density. at the critical point, this derivative is zero, leading to large fluctuations. the effect of density fluctuations is that light of all wavelengths is scattered, making the fluid look milky white. einstein relates this to rayleigh scattering, which is what happens when the fluctuation size is much smaller than the wavelength, and which explains why the sky is blue. einstein quantitatively derived critical opalescence from a treatment of density fluctuations, and demonstrated how both the effect and rayleigh scattering originate from the atomistic constitution of matter.

einstein's """"zur elektrodynamik bewegter kã¶rper"""" (""on the electrodynamics of moving bodies"") was received on 30 june 1905 and published 26 september of that same year. it reconciled conflicts between maxwell's equations (the laws of electricity and magnetism) and the laws of newtonian mechanics by introducing changes to the laws of mechanics. observationally, the effects of these changes are most apparent at high speeds (where objects are moving at speeds close to the speed of light). the theory developed in this paper later became known as einstein's special theory of relativity.

this paper predicted that, when measured in the frame of a relatively moving observer, a clock carried by a moving body would appear to slow down, and the body itself would contract in its direction of motion. this paper also argued that the idea of a luminiferous aetherâone of the leading theoretical entities in physics at the timeâwas superfluous.

in his paper on massâenergy equivalence, einstein produced ""e""â =â ""mc"" as a consequence of his special relativity equations. einstein's 1905 work on relativity remained controversial for many years, but was accepted by leading physicists, starting with max planck.

einstein originally framed special relativity in terms of kinematics (the study of moving bodies). in 1908, hermann minkowski reinterpreted special relativity in geometric terms as a theory of spacetime. einstein adopted minkowski's formalism in his 1915 general theory of relativity.

general relativity (gr) is a theory of gravitation that was developed by einstein between 1907 and 1915. according to general relativity, the observed gravitational attraction between masses results from the warping of space and time by those masses. general relativity has developed into an essential tool in modern astrophysics. it provides the foundation for the current understanding of black holes, regions of space where gravitational attraction is so strong that not even light can escape.

as einstein later said, the reason for the development of general relativity was that the preference of inertial motions within special relativity was unsatisfactory, while a theory which from the outset prefers no state of motion (even accelerated ones) should appear more satisfactory. consequently, in 1907 he published an article on acceleration under special relativity. in that article titled ""on the relativity principle and the conclusions drawn from it"", he argued that free fall is really inertial motion, and that for a free-falling observer the rules of special relativity must apply. this argument is called the equivalence principle. in the same article, einstein also predicted the phenomena of gravitational time dilation, gravitational redshift and deflection of light.

in 1911, einstein published another article ""on the influence of gravitation on the propagation of light"" expanding on the 1907 article, in which he estimated the amount of deflection of light by massive bodies. thus, the theoretical prediction of general relativity could for the first time be tested experimentally.

in 1916, einstein predicted gravitational waves, ripples in the curvature of spacetime which propagate as waves, traveling outward from the source, transporting energy as gravitational radiation. the existence of gravitational waves is possible under general relativity due to its lorentz invariance which brings the concept of a finite speed of propagation of the physical interactions of gravity with it. by contrast, gravitational waves cannot exist in the newtonian theory of gravitation, which postulates that the physical interactions of gravity propagate at infinite speed.

the first, indirect, detection of gravitational waves came in the 1970s through observation of a pair of closely orbiting neutron stars, psr b1913+16. the explanation of the decay in their orbital period was that they were emitting gravitational waves. einstein's prediction was confirmed on 11 february 2016, when researchers at ligo published the first observation of gravitational waves, detected on earth on 14 september 2015, exactly one hundred years after the prediction.

while developing general relativity, einstein became confused about the gauge invariance in the theory. he formulated an argument that led him to conclude that a general relativistic field theory is impossible. he gave up looking for fully generally covariant tensor equations, and searched for equations that would be invariant under general linear transformations only.

in june 1913, the entwurf ('draft') theory was the result of these investigations. as its name suggests, it was a sketch of a theory, less elegant and more difficult than general relativity, with the equations of motion supplemented by additional gauge fixing conditions. after more than two years of intensive work, einstein realized that the hole argument was mistaken and abandoned the theory in november 1915.

in 1917, einstein applied the general theory of relativity to the structure of the universe as a whole. he discovered that the general field equations predicted a universe that was dynamic, either contracting or expanding. as observational evidence for a dynamic universe was not known at the time, einstein introduced a new term, the cosmological constant, to the field equations, in order to allow the theory to predict a static universe. the modified field equations predicted a static universe of closed curvature, in accordance with einstein's understanding of mach's principle in these years. this model became known as the einstein world or einstein's static universe.

following the discovery of the recession of the nebulae by edwin hubble in 1929, einstein abandoned his static model of the universe, and proposed two dynamic models of the cosmos, the friedmann-einstein universe of 1931 and the einsteinâde sitter universe of 1932. in each of these models, einstein discarded the cosmological constant, claiming that it was ""in any case theoretically unsatisfactory"".

in many einstein biographies, it is claimed that einstein referred to the cosmological constant in later years as his ""biggest blunder"". the astrophysicist mario livio has recently cast doubt on this claim, suggesting that it may be exaggerated.

in late 2013, a team led by the irish physicist cormac o'raifeartaigh discovered evidence that, shortly after learning of hubble's observations of the recession of the nebulae, einstein considered a steady-state model of the universe. in a hitherto overlooked manuscript, apparently written in early 1931, einstein explored a model of the expanding universe in which the density of matter remains constant due to a continuous creation of matter, a process he associated with the cosmological constant. as he stated in the paper, ""in what follows, i would like to draw attention to a solution to equation (1) that can account for hubbel's [""sic""] facts, and in which the density is constant over time"" ... ""if one considers a physically bounded volume, particles of matter will be continually leaving it. for the density to remain constant, new particles of matter must be continually formed in the volume from space.""

it thus appears that einstein considered a steady-state model of the expanding universe many years before hoyle, bondi and gold. however, einstein's steady-state model contained a fundamental flaw and he quickly abandoned the idea.

general relativity includes a dynamical spacetime, so it is difficult to see how to identify the conserved energy and momentum. noether's theorem allows these quantities to be determined from a lagrangian with translation invariance, but general covariance makes translation invariance into something of a gauge symmetry. the energy and momentum derived within general relativity by noether's prescriptions do not make a real tensor for this reason.

einstein argued that this is true for a fundamental reason: the gravitational field could be made to vanish by a choice of coordinates. he maintained that the non-covariant energy momentum pseudotensor was in fact the best description of the energy momentum distribution in a gravitational field. this approach has been echoed by lev landau and evgeny lifshitz, and others, and has become standard.

the use of non-covariant objects like pseudotensors was heavily criticized in 1917 by erwin schrã¶dinger and others.

in 1935, einstein collaborated with nathan rosen to produce a model of a wormhole, often called einsteinârosen bridges. his motivation was to model elementary particles with charge as a solution of gravitational field equations, in line with the program outlined in the paper ""do gravitational fields play an important role in the constitution of the elementary particles?"". these solutions cut and pasted schwarzschild black holes to make a bridge between two patches.

if one end of a wormhole was positively charged, the other end would be negatively charged. these properties led einstein to believe that pairs of particles and antiparticles could be described in this way.

in order to incorporate spinning point particles into general relativity, the affine connection needed to be generalized to include an antisymmetric part, called the torsion. this modification was made by einstein and cartan in the 1920s.

the theory of general relativity has a fundamental lawthe einstein field equations, which describe how space curves. the geodesic equation, which describes how particles move, may be derived from the einstein field equations.

since the equations of general relativity are non-linear, a lump of energy made out of pure gravitational fields, like a black hole, would move on a trajectory which is determined by the einstein field equations themselves, not by a new law. so einstein proposed that the path of a singular solution, like a black hole, would be determined to be a geodesic from general relativity itself.

this was established by einstein, infeld, and hoffmann for pointlike objects without angular momentum, and by roy kerr for spinning objects.

in a 1905 paper, einstein postulated that light itself consists of localized particles (""quanta""). einstein's light quanta were nearly universally rejected by all physicists, including max planck and niels bohr. this idea only became universally accepted in 1919, with robert millikan's detailed experiments on the photoelectric effect, and with the measurement of compton scattering.

einstein concluded that each wave of frequency ""f"" is associated with a collection of photons with energy ""hf"" each, where ""h"" is planck's constant. he does not say much more, because he is not sure how the particles are related to the wave. but he does suggest that this idea would explain certain experimental results, notably the photoelectric effect.

in 1907, einstein proposed a model of matter where each atom in a lattice structure is an independent harmonic oscillator. in the einstein model, each atom oscillates independentlyâa series of equally spaced quantized states for each oscillator. einstein was aware that getting the frequency of the actual oscillations would be difficult, but he nevertheless proposed this theory because it was a particularly clear demonstration that quantum mechanics could solve the specific heat problem in classical mechanics. peter debye refined this model.

throughout the 1910s, quantum mechanics expanded in scope to cover many different systems. after ernest rutherford discovered the nucleus and proposed that electrons orbit like planets, niels bohr was able to show that the same quantum mechanical postulates introduced by planck and developed by einstein would explain the discrete motion of electrons in atoms, and the periodic table of the elements.

einstein contributed to these developments by linking them with the 1898 arguments wilhelm wien had made. wien had shown that the hypothesis of adiabatic invariance of a thermal equilibrium state allows all the blackbody curves at different temperature to be derived from one another by a simple shifting process. einstein noted in 1911 that the same adiabatic principle shows that the quantity which is quantized in any mechanical motion must be an adiabatic invariant. arnold sommerfeld identified this adiabatic invariant as the action variable of classical mechanics.

in 1924, einstein received a description of a statistical model from indian physicist satyendra nath bose, based on a counting method that assumed that light could be understood as a gas of indistinguishable particles. einstein noted that bose's statistics applied to some atoms as well as to the proposed light particles, and submitted his translation of bose's paper to the ""zeitschrift fã¼r physik"". einstein also published his own articles describing the model and its implications, among them the boseâeinstein condensate phenomenon that some particulates should appear at very low temperatures. it was not until 1995 that the first such condensate was produced experimentally by eric allin cornell and carl wieman using ultra-cooling equipment built at the nistâjila laboratory at the university of colorado at boulder. boseâeinstein statistics are now used to describe the behaviors of any assembly of bosons. einstein's sketches for this project may be seen in the einstein archive in the library of the leiden university.

although the patent office promoted einstein to technical examiner second class in 1906, he had not given up on academia. in 1908, he became a ""privatdozent"" at the university of bern. in """"ãber die entwicklung unserer anschauungen ã¼ber das wesen und die konstitution der strahlung"""" (""""), on the quantization of light, and in an earlier 1909 paper, einstein showed that max planck's energy quanta must have well-defined momenta and act in some respects as independent, point-like particles. this paper introduced the ""photon"" concept (although the name ""photon"" was introduced later by gilbert n. lewis in 1926) and inspired the notion of waveâparticle duality in quantum mechanics. einstein saw this waveâparticle duality in radiation as concrete evidence for his conviction that physics needed a new, unified foundation.

in a series of works completed from 1911 to 1913, planck reformulated his 1900 quantum theory and introduced the idea of zero-point energy in his ""second quantum theory"". soon, this idea attracted the attention of einstein and his assistant otto stern. assuming the energy of rotating diatomic molecules contains zero-point energy, they then compared the theoretical specific heat of hydrogen gas with the experimental data. the numbers matched nicely. however, after publishing the findings, they promptly withdrew their support, because they no longer had confidence in the correctness of the idea of zero-point energy.

in 1917, at the height of his work on relativity, einstein published an article in ""physikalische zeitschrift"" that proposed the possibility of stimulated emission, the physical process that makes possible the maser and the laser.
this article showed that the statistics of absorption and emission of light would only be consistent with planck's distribution law if the emission of light into a mode with n photons would be enhanced statistically compared to the emission of light into an empty mode. this paper was enormously influential in the later development of quantum mechanics, because it was the first paper to show that the statistics of atomic transitions had simple laws.

einstein discovered louis de broglie's work and supported his ideas, which were received skeptically at first. in another major paper from this era, einstein gave a wave equation for de broglie waves, which einstein suggested was the hamiltonâjacobi equation of mechanics. this paper would inspire schrã¶dinger's work of 1926.

einstein was displeased with modern quantum mechanics as it had evolved after 1925. contrary to popular belief, his doubts were not due to a conviction that god ""is not playing at dice"". indeed, it was einstein himself, in his 1917 paper that proposed the possibility of stimulated emission, who first proposed the fundamental role of chance in explaining quantum processes. rather, he objected to what quantum mechanics implies about the nature of reality. einstein believed that a physical reality exists independent of our ability to observe it. in contrast, bohr and his followers maintained that all we can know are the results of measurements and observations, and that it makes no sense to speculate about an ultimate reality that exists beyond our perceptions.

 the bohrâeinstein debates were a series of public disputes about quantum mechanics between einstein and niels bohr, who were two of its founders. their debates are remembered because of their importance to the philosophy of science. their debates would influence later interpretations of quantum mechanics.

in 1935, einstein returned quantum mechanics, in particular to the question of its completeness, in the ""epr paper"". in a thought experiment, he considered two particles which had interacted such that their properties were strongly correlated. no matter how far the two particles were separated, a precise position measurement on one particle would result in equally precise knowledge of the position of the other particle; likewise a precise momentum measurement of one particle would result in equally precise knowledge of the momentum of the other particle, without needing to disturb the other particle in any way.

given einstein's concept of local realism, there were two possibilities: (1) either the other particle had these properties already determined, or (2) the process of measuring the first particle instantaneously affected the reality of the position and momentum of the second particle. einstein rejected this second possibility (popularly called ""spooky action at a distance"").

einstein's belief in local realism led him to assert that, while the correctness of quantum mechanics was not in question, it must be incomplete. but as a physical principle, local realism was shown to be incorrect when the aspect experiment of 1982 confirmed bell's theorem, which j. s. bell had delineated in 1964. the results of these and subsequent experiments demonstrate that quantum physics cannot be represented by any version of the picture of physics in which ""particles are regarded as unconnected independent classical-like entities, each one being unable to communicate with the other after they have separated.""

although einstein was wrong about local realism, his clear prediction of the unusual properties of its opposite, ""entangled quantum states"", has resulted in the epr paper becoming among the top ten papers published in physical review. it is considered a centerpiece of the development of quantum information theory.

following his research on general relativity, einstein entered into a series of attempts to generalize his geometric theory of gravitation to include electromagnetism as another aspect of a single entity. in 1950, he described his ""unified field theory"" in a ""scientific american"" article titled ""on the generalized theory of gravitation"". although he continued to be lauded for his work, einstein became increasingly isolated in his research, and his efforts were ultimately unsuccessful.
in his pursuit of a unification of the fundamental forces, einstein ignored some mainstream developments in physics, most notably the strong and weak nuclear forces, which were not well understood until many years after his death. mainstream physics, in turn, largely ignored einstein's approaches to unification. einstein's dream of unifying other laws of physics with gravity motivates modern quests for a theory of everything and in particular string theory, where geometrical fields emerge in a unified quantum-mechanical setting.

einstein conducted other investigations that were unsuccessful and abandoned. these pertain to force, superconductivity, and other research.

in addition to longtime collaborators leopold infeld, nathan rosen, peter bergmann and others, einstein also had some one-shot collaborations with various scientists.

einstein and de haas demonstrated that magnetization is due to the motion of electrons, nowadays known to be the spin. in order to show this, they reversed the magnetization in an iron bar suspended on a torsion pendulum. they confirmed that this leads the bar to rotate, because the electron's angular momentum changes as the magnetization changes. this experiment needed to be sensitive, because the angular momentum associated with electrons is small, but it definitively established that electron motion of some kind is responsible for magnetization.

einstein suggested to erwin schrã¶dinger that he might be able to reproduce the statistics of a boseâeinstein gas by considering a box. then to each possible quantum motion of a particle in a box associate an independent harmonic oscillator. quantizing these oscillators, each level will have an integer occupation number, which will be the number of particles in it.

this formulation is a form of second quantization, but it predates modern quantum mechanics. erwin schrã¶dinger applied this to derive the thermodynamic properties of a semiclassical ideal gas. schrã¶dinger urged einstein to add his name as co-author, although einstein declined the invitation.

in 1926, einstein and his former student leã³ szilã¡rd co-invented (and in 1930, patented) the einstein refrigerator. this absorption refrigerator was then revolutionary for having no moving parts and using only heat as an input. on 11 november 1930, was awarded to einstein and leã³ szilã¡rd for the refrigerator. their invention was not immediately put into commercial production, and the most promising of their patents were acquired by the swedish company electrolux.

while traveling, einstein wrote daily to his wife elsa and adopted stepdaughters margot and ilse. the letters were included in the papers bequeathed to the hebrew university. margot einstein permitted the personal letters to be made available to the public, but requested that it not be done until twenty years after her death (she died in 1986). einstein had expressed his interest in the plumbing profession and was made an honorary member of the plumbers and steamfitters union. barbara wolff, of the hebrew university's albert einstein archives, told the bbc that there are about 3,500 pages of private correspondence written between 1912 and 1955.

corbis, successor to the roger richman agency, licenses the use of his name and associated imagery, as agent for the university.

in the period before world war ii, ""the new yorker"" published a vignette in their ""the talk of the town"" feature saying that einstein was so well known in america that he would be stopped on the street by people wanting him to explain ""that theory"". he finally figured out a way to handle the incessant inquiries. he told his inquirers ""pardon me, sorry! always i am mistaken for professor einstein.""

einstein has been the subject of or inspiration for many novels, films, plays, and works of music. he is a favorite model for depictions of mad scientists and absent-minded professors; his expressive face and distinctive hairstyle have been widely copied and exaggerated. ""time"" magazine's frederic golden wrote that einstein was ""a cartoonist's dream come true"".

many popular quotations are often misattributed to him.

einstein received numerous awards and honors, and in 1922, he was awarded the 1921 nobel prize in physics ""for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect"". none of the nominations in 1921 met the criteria set by alfred nobel, so the 1921 prize was carried forward and awarded to einstein in 1922.

lionel messi,"
lionel andrã©s messi cuccittini (; born 24 june 1987) is an argentine professional footballer who plays as a forward and captains both spanish club barcelona and the argentina national team. often considered the best player in the world and widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, messi has won a record six fifa ballon d'or/best fifa men's player awards, and a record six european golden shoes. he has spent his entire professional career with barcelona, where he has won a club-record 34 trophies, including ten la liga titles, four uefa champions league titles and six copas del rey. a prolific goalscorer and a creative playmaker, messi holds the records for most goals in la liga (421), a la liga and european league season (50), most hat-tricks in the uefa champions league (8), and most assists in la liga (164) and the copa amã©rica (13). he has scored over 670 senior career goals for club and country.

born and raised in central argentina, messi was diagnosed with a growth hormone deficiency as a child. at age 13, he relocated to spain to join barcelona, who agreed to pay for his medical treatment. after a fast progression through barcelona's youth academy, messi made his competitive debut aged 17 in october 2004. despite being injury-prone during his early career, he established himself as an integral player for the club within the next three years, finishing 2007 as a finalist for both the ballon d'or and fifa world player of the year award, a feat he repeated the following year. his first uninterrupted season was 2008â09, during which he helped barcelona achieve the first treble in spanish football. at 22 years old, messi won the 2009 ballon d'or and the 2009 fifa world player of the year award by record voting margins. three successful seasons followed, with messi winning three consecutive fifa ballons d'or, including an unprecedented fourth. during the 2011â12 season, he set the la liga and european records for most goals scored in a single season, while establishing himself as barcelona's all-time top scorer in official competitions in march 2012. the following two seasons, messi finished twice second for the ballon d'or behind cristiano ronaldo, his perceived career rival. messi regained his best form during the 2014â15 campaign, breaking the all-time goalscoring records in both la liga and the champions league in november 2014, and leading barcelona to a historic second treble.

an argentine international, messi is his country's all-time leading goalscorer. at youth level, he won the 2005 fifa world youth championship, finishing the tournament with both the golden ball and golden shoe, and an olympic gold medal at the 2008 summer olympics. his style of play as a diminutive, left-footed dribbler drew comparisons with his compatriot diego maradona, who described messi as his successor. after his senior debut in august 2005, messi became the youngest argentine to play and score in a fifa world cup during the 2006 edition, and reached the final of the 2007 copa amã©rica, where he was named young player of the tournament. as the squad's captain from august 2011, he led argentina to three consecutive finals: the 2014 fifa world cup, for which he won the golden ball, and the 2015 and 2016 copas amã©rica. after announcing his international retirement in 2016, he reversed his decision and led his country to qualification for the 2018 fifa world cup, and a third-place finish at the 2019 copa amã©rica.

according to ""france football"", messi was the world's highest-paid footballer for five years out of six between 2009 and 2014, and was ranked the world's highest-paid athlete by ""forbes"" in 2019. he was among ""time""'s 100 most influential people in the world in 2011 and 2012. one of the most famous athletes in the world, messi has been sponsored by sportswear company adidas since 2006 and has established himself as their leading brand endorser.

lionel andrã©s messi was born on 24 june 1987 in rosario, the third of the four children of jorge messi, a steel factory manager, and his wife celia cuccittini, who worked in a magnet manufacturing workshop. on his father's side, he is of italian and spanish descent, the great-grandson of immigrants from the northcentral adriatic marche region of italy and catalonia, and on his mother's side, he has primarily italian ancestry. growing up in a tight-knit, football-loving family, ""leo"" developed a passion for the sport from an early age, playing constantly with his older brothers, rodrigo and matã­as, and his cousins, maximiliano and emanuel biancucchi, both of whom became professional footballers. at the age of four he joined local club grandoli, where he was coached by his father, though his earliest influence as a player came from his maternal grandmother, celia, who accompanied him to training and matches. he was greatly affected by her death, shortly before his eleventh birthday; since then, as a devout catholic, he has celebrated his goals by looking up and pointing to the sky in tribute of his grandmother.
a lifelong supporter of newell's old boys, messi joined the rosario club when he was six years old. during the six years he played for newell's, he scored almost 500 goals as a member of ""the machine of '87"", the near-unbeatable youth side named for the year of their birth, and regularly entertained crowds by performing ball tricks during half-time of the first team's home games. however, his future as a professional player was threatened when, at age 10, he was diagnosed with a growth hormone deficiency. as his father's health insurance covered only two years of growth hormone treatment, which cost at least $1,000 per month, newell's agreed to contribute, but later reneged on their promise. he was scouted by buenos aires club river plate, whose playmaker, pablo aimar, he idolised, but they were also unable to pay for his treatment due to the country's economic collapse. his goalscoring idol growing up was ronaldo, with messi calling him ""the best forward i've ever seen"".
as the messi family had relatives in catalonia, they sought to arrange a trial with barcelona in september 2000. first team director charly rexach immediately wanted to sign him, but the board of directors hesitated; at the time it was highly unusual for european clubs to sign foreign players of such a young age. on 14 december, an ultimatum was issued for barcelona to prove their commitment, and rexach, with no other paper at hand, offered a contract on a paper napkin. in february 2001, the family relocated to barcelona, where they moved into an apartment near the club's stadium, camp nou. during his first year in spain, messi rarely played with the ""infantiles"" due to a transfer conflict with newell's; as a foreigner, he could only be fielded in friendlies and the catalan league. without football, he struggled to integrate into the team; already reserved by nature, he was so quiet that his teammates initially believed he was mute. at home, he suffered from homesickness after his mother moved back to rosario with his brothers and little sister, marã­a sol, while he stayed in barcelona with his father.

after a year at barcelona's youth academy, la masia, messi was finally enrolled in the royal spanish football federation (rfef) in february 2002. now playing in all competitions, he befriended his teammates, among whom were cesc fã bregas and gerard piquã©. after completing his growth hormone treatment aged 14, messi became an integral part of the ""baby dream team"", barcelona's greatest-ever youth side. during his first full season (2002â03), he was top scorer with 36 goals in 30 games for the ""cadetes"" a, who won an unprecedented treble of the league and both the spanish and catalan cups. the copa catalunya final, a 4â1 victory over espanyol, became known in club lore as the ""partido de la mã¡scara"", the final of the mask. a week after suffering a broken cheekbone during a league match, messi was allowed to start the game on the condition that he wear a plastic protector; soon hindered by the mask, he took it off and scored two goals in 10 minutes before his substitution. at the close of the season, he received an offer to join arsenal, his first from a foreign club, but while fã bregas and piquã© soon left for england, he chose to remain in barcelona.

during the 2003â04 season, his fourth with barcelona, messi rapidly progressed through the club's ranks, debuting for a record five teams in a single campaign. after being named player of the tournament in four international pre-season competitions with the ""juveniles"" b, he played only one official match with the team before being promoted to the ""juveniles a"", where he scored 18 goals in 11 league games. messi was then one of several youth players called up to strengthen a depleted first team during the international break. french winger ludovic giuly explained how a teenage leo caught the eye in a training session with frank rijkaard's first team: ""he destroyed us all... they were kicking him all over the place to avoid being ridiculed by this kid, he just got up and kept on playing. he would dribble past four players and score a goal. even the team's starting centre-backs were nervous. he was an alien.""

at 16 years, four months, and 23 days old, messi made his first team debut when he came on in the 75th minute during a friendly against josã© mourinho's porto on 16 november 2003. his performance, creating two chances and a shot on goal, impressed the technical staff, and he subsequently began training daily with the club's reserve side, barcelona b, as well as weekly with the first team. after his first training session with the senior squad, barã§a's new star player, ronaldinho, told his teammates that he believed the 16-year-old would become an even better player than himself. ronaldinho soon befriended messi, whom he called ""little brother"", which greatly eased his transition into the first team.

to gain further match experience, messi joined barcelona c in addition to the ""juveniles"" a, playing his first game for the third team on 29 november. he helped save them from the relegation zone of the tercera divisiã³n, scoring five goals in ten games, including a hat-trick in eight minutes during a copa del rey match while man-marked by sevilla's sergio ramos. his progress was reflected in his first professional contract, signed on 4 february 2004, which lasted until 2012 and contained an initial buyout clause of â¬30â million. a month later, on 6 march, he made his debut for barcelona b in the segunda divisiã³n b, and his buyout clause automatically increased to â¬80â million. he played five games with the b team that season but did not score. physically he was weaker than his opponents, who were often much older and taller, and in training he worked on increasing his muscle mass and overall strength in order to be able to shake off defenders. towards the end of the season, he returned to both youth teams, helping the ""juveniles"" b win the league. he finished the campaign having scored for four of his five teams with a total of 36 goals in all official competitions.

during the 2004â05 season, messi was a guaranteed starter for the b team, playing 17 games throughout the campaign and scoring on six occasions. since his debut the previous november, he had not been called up to the first team again, but in october 2004, the senior players asked manager frank rijkaard to promote him. since ronaldinho already played on the left wing, rijkaard moved messi from his usual position onto the right flank (though initially against the player's wishes), allowing him to cut into the centre of the pitch and shoot with his dominant left foot. messi made his league debut during the next match on 16 october, against espanyol, coming on in the 82nd minute. at 17 years, three months, and 22 days old, he was at the time the youngest player to represent barcelona in an official competition. as a substitute player, he played 77 minutes in nine matches for the first team that season, including his debut in the uefa champions league against shakhtar donetsk. he scored his first senior goal on 1 may 2005, against albacete, from an assist by ronaldinho, becoming â at that time â the youngest-ever scorer for the club. barcelona, in their second season under rijkaard, won the league for the first time in six years.

on 24 june 2005, his 18th birthday, messi signed his first contract as a senior team player. it made him a barcelona player until 2010, two years less than his previous contract, but his buyout clause increased to â¬150â million. his breakthrough came two months later, on 24 august, during the joan gamper trophy, barcelona's pre-season competition. a starter for the first time, he gave a well-received performance against fabio capello's juventus, receiving an ovation from the camp nou. while capello requested to loan messi, a bid to buy him came from inter milan, who were willing to pay his â¬150 million buyout clause and triple his wages. according to then-president joan laporta, it was the only time the club faced a real risk of losing messi, but he ultimately decided to stay. on 16 september, his contract was updated for the second time in three months and extended to 2014.

due to issues regarding his legal status in the royal spanish football federation, messi missed the start of la liga, but on 26 september, he acquired spanish citizenship and became eligible to play. wearing the number 19 shirt, he gradually established himself as the first-choice right winger, forming an attacking trio with ronaldinho and striker samuel eto'o. he was in the starting line-up in major matches like his first ""clã¡sico"" against rivals real madrid on 19 november, as well as barcelona's away victory over chelsea in the last 16 round of the champions league. after he had scored 8 goals in 25 games, including his first in the champions league, his season ended prematurely during the return leg against chelsea on 7 march 2006, when he suffered a torn hamstring. messi worked to regain fitness in time for the champions league final, but on 17 may, the day of the final, he was eventually ruled out. he was so disappointed that he did not celebrate his team's victory over arsenal in paris, something he later came to regret.

while barcelona began a gradual decline, the 19-year-old messi established himself as one of the best players in the world during the 2006â07 campaign. already an idol to the ""culã©s"", the club's supporters, he scored 17 goals in 36 games across all competitions. however, he continued to be plagued by major injuries; a metatarsal fracture sustained on 12 november 2006 kept him out of action for three months. he recovered in time for the last 16 round of the champions league against liverpool, but was effectively marked out of the game; barcelona, the reigning champions, were out of the competition. in the league, his goal contribution increased towards the end of the season; 11 of his 14 goals came from the last 13 games. on 10 march 2007, he scored his first hat-trick in a ""clã¡sico"", the first player to do so in 12 years, equalising after each goal by real madrid to end the match in a 3â3 draw in injury time. his growing importance to the club was reflected in a new contract, signed that month, which greatly increased his wages.

already frequently compared to compatriot diego maradona, messi proved their similarity when he nearly replicated maradona's two most famous goals in the span of three weeks. during a copa del rey semi-final against getafe on 18 april, he scored a goal remarkably similar to maradona's goal in the quarter-finals of the 1986 fifa world cup, known as the goal of the century. messi collected the ball on the right side near the halfway line, ran , and beat five defenders before scoring with an angled finish, just as maradona had done. a league match against espanyol on 9 june saw him score by launching himself at the ball and guiding it past the goalkeeper with his hand in similar fashion to maradona's hand of god goal in the same world cup match. as messi continued his individual rise, barcelona faltered; the team failed to reach the copa del rey final after messi was rested during the second leg against getafe and lost the league to real madrid on head-to-head results.

after ronaldinho lost form, messi became barã§a's new star player at only 20 years old, receiving the nickname ""messiah"" from the spanish media. his efforts in 2007 also earned him award recognition; journalists voted him the third-best player of the year for the 2007 ballon d'or, behind kakã¡ and runner-up cristiano ronaldo, while international managers and national team captains voted him second for the fifa world player of the year award, again behind kakã¡. although he managed to score 16 goals during the 2007â08 campaign, the second half of his season was again marred by injuries after he suffered a torn hamstring on 15 december. he returned to score twice in their away victory against celtic in the last 16 round of the champions league, becoming the competition's top scorer at that point with six goals, but reinjured himself during the return leg on 4 march 2008. rijkaard had fielded him despite warning from the medical staff, leading captain carles puyol to criticise the spanish media for pressuring messi to play every match. barcelona finished the season without trophies, eliminated in the champions league semi-finals by the eventual champions, manchester united, and placed third in the league.

after two unsuccessful seasons, barcelona were in need of an overhaul, leading to the departure of rijkaard and ronaldinho. upon the latter's departure, messi was given the number 10 shirt. he signed a new contract in july 2008 on an annual salary of â¬7.8â million, becoming the club's highest-paid player. ahead of the new season, a major concern remained his frequent muscular injuries, which had left him side-lined for a total of eight months between 2006 and 2008. to combat the problem, the club implemented new training, nutrition, and lifestyle regimens, and assigned him a personal physiotherapist, who would travel with him during call-ups for the argentina national team. as a result, messi remained virtually injury-free during the next four years, allowing him to reach his full potential. despite his injuries early in the year, his performances in 2008 saw him again voted runner-up for the ballon d'or and the fifa world player of the year award, both times behind cristiano ronaldo.

in his first uninterrupted campaign, the 2008â09 season, he scored 38 goals in 51 games, contributing alongside eto'o and winger thierry henry to a total of 100 goals in all competitions, a record at the time for the club.

during his first season under barcelona's new manager, former captain pep guardiola, messi played mainly on the right wing, like he had under rijkaard, though this time as a false winger with the freedom to cut inside and roam the centre. during the ""clã¡sico"" on 2 may 2009, however, he played for the first time as a false nine, positioned as a centre-forward but dropping deep into midfield to link up with xavi and andrã©s iniesta. he assisted his side's first goal and scored twice to end the match in an emphatic 6â2 victory, the team's greatest-ever score at real madrid's santiago bernabã©u stadium. returning to the wing, he played his first final since breaking into the first team on 13 may, scoring once and assisting a second goal as barcelona defeated athletic bilbao 4â1 to win the copa del rey. with 23 league goals from messi that season, barcelona became la liga champions three days later and achieved its fifth double.

as the season's champions league top scorer with nine goals, the youngest in the tournament's history, messi scored two goals and assisted two more to ensure a 4â0 quarter-final victory over bayern munich. he returned as a false nine during the final on 27 may in rome against manchester united. barcelona were crowned champions of europe by winning the match 2â0, the second goal coming from a messi header over goalkeeper edwin van der sar. barcelona thus achieved the first treble in the history of spanish football. this success was reflected in a new contract, signed on 18 september, which committed messi to the club through 2016 with a new buyout clause of â¬250â million, while his salary increased to â¬12â million. his team's prosperity continued into the second half of 2009, as barcelona became the first club to achieve the sextuple, winning six top-tier trophies in a single year. after victories in the supercopa de espaã±a and uefa super cup in august, barcelona won the fifa club world cup against estudiantes de la plata on 19 december, with messi scoring the winning 2â1 goal with his chest. at 22 years old, messi won the ballon d'or and the fifa world player of the year award, both times by the greatest voting margin in each trophy's history.

unsatisfied with his position on the right wing, messi resumed playing as a false nine in early 2010, beginning with a champions league last 16-round match against vfb stuttgart. after a first-leg draw, barcelona won the second leg 4â0 with two goals and an assist from messi. at that point, he effectively became the tactical focal point of guardiola's team, and his goalscoring rate increased. messi scored a total of 47 goals in all competitions that season, equaling ronaldo's club record from the 1996â97 campaign. he scored all of his side's four goals in the champions league quarter-final against arsã¨ne wenger's arsenal on 6 april while becoming barcelona's all-time top scorer in the competition. although barcelona were eliminated in the champions league semi-finals by the eventual champions, inter milan, messi finished the season as top scorer (with 8 goals) for the second consecutive year. as the league's top scorer with 34 goals (again tying ronaldo's record), he helped barcelona win a second consecutive la liga trophy with only a single defeat.

messi secured barcelona's first trophy of the 2010â11 campaign, the supercopa de espaã±a, by scoring a hat-trick in his side's second-leg 4â0 victory over sevilla, after a first-leg defeat. assuming a playmaking role, he was again instrumental in a ""clã¡sico"" on 29 november 2010, the first with josã© mourinho in charge of real madrid, as barcelona defeated their rivals 5â0. messi helped the team achieve 16 consecutive league victories, a record in spanish football, concluding with another hat-trick against atlã©tico madrid on 5 february 2011. his club performances in 2010 earned him the inaugural fifa ballon d'or, an amalgamation of the ballon d'or and the fifa world player of the year award, though his win was met with some criticism due to his lack of success with argentina at the 2010 fifa world cup. under the award's old format, he would have placed just outside the top three, owing his win to the votes from the international coaches and captains.

towards the end of the season, barcelona played four ""clã¡sicos"" in the span of 18 days. a league match on 16 april ended in a draw after a penalty from messi. after barcelona lost the copa del rey final four days later, messi scored both goals in his side's 2â0 win in the first leg of the champions league semi-finals in madrid, the second of which â a slaloming dribble past three real players â was acclaimed as one of the best ever in the competition. although he did not score, he was again important in the second-leg draw that sent barcelona through to the champions league final, where they faced manchester united in a repeat of the final two years earlier. as the competition's top scorer for the third consecutive year, with 12 goals, messi gave a man-of-the-match performance at wembley on 28 may, scoring the match-winning goal of barã§a's 3â1 victory. barcelona won a third consecutive la liga title. in addition to his 31 goals, messi was also the league's top assist provider with 18. he finished the season with 53 goals and 24 assists in all competitions, becoming barcelona's all-time single-season top scorer and the first player in spanish football to reach the 50-goal benchmark.

as messi developed into a combination of a number 8 (a creator), a 9 (scorer), and a 10 (assistant), he scored an unprecedented 73 goals and provided 29 assists in all club competitions during the 2011â12 season, producing a hat-trick or more on 10 occasions. he began the campaign by helping barcelona win both the spanish and european super cups; in the supercopa de espaã±a, he scored three times to achieve a 5â4 aggregate victory over real madrid, overtaking raãºl as the competition's all-time top scorer with eight goals. at the close of the year, on 18 december, he scored twice in the fifa club world cup final, a 4â0 victory over santos, earning the golden ball as the best player of the tournament, as he had done two years previously. for his efforts in 2011, he again received the fifa ballon d'or, becoming only the fourth player in history to win the ballon d'or three times, after johan cruyff, michel platini, and marco van basten. additionally, he won the inaugural uefa best player in europe award, a revival of the old-style ballon d'or. by then, messi was already widely considered one of the best footballers in history, alongside players like diego maradona and pelã©.

as messi maintained his goalscoring form into the second half of the season, the year 2012 saw him break several longstanding records. on 7 march, two weeks after scoring four goals in a league fixture against valencia, he scored five times in a champions league last 16-round match against bayer leverkusen, an unprecedented achievement in the history of the competition. in addition to being the joint top assist provider with five assists, this feat made him top scorer with 14 goals, tying josã© altafini's record from the 1962â63 season, as well as becoming only the second player after gerd mã¼ller to be top scorer in four campaigns. two weeks later, on 20 march, messi became the top goalscorer in barcelona's history at 24 years old, overtaking the 57-year record of cã©sar rodrã­guez's 232 goals with a hat-trick against granada.

despite messi's individual form, barcelona's four-year cycle of success under guardiola â one of the greatest eras in the club's history â drew to an end. although barcelona won the copa del rey against athletic bilbao on 25 may, its 14th title of that period, the team lost the league to real madrid and was eliminated in the champions league semi-finals by the eventual champions, chelsea, with messi sending a crucial second-leg penalty kick against the crossbar. in barã§a's last home league match on 5 may, against espanyol, messi scored all four goals before approaching the bench to embrace guardiola, who had announced his resignation as manager. he finished the season as league top scorer in spain and europe for a second time, with 50 goals, a la liga record, while his 73 goals in all competitions surpassed gerd mã¼ller's 67 goals in the 1972â73 bundesliga season, making him the single-season top scorer in the history of european club football.

under manager tito vilanova, who had first coached him aged 14 at ""la masia"", messi helped the club achieve its best-ever start to a la liga season during the second half of 2012, amassing 55 points by the competition's midway point, a record in spanish football. a double scored on 9 december against real betis saw messi break two longstanding records: he surpassed cã©sar rodrã­guez's record of 190 league goals, becoming barcelona's all-time top scorer in la liga, and gerd mã¼ller's record of most goals scored in a calendar year, overtaking his 85 goals scored in 1972 for bayern munich and germany. messi sent mã¼ller a number 10 barcelona shirt, signed ""with respect and admiration"", after breaking his 40-year record. at the close of the year, messi had scored a record 91 goals in all competitions for barcelona and argentina. although fifa did not acknowledge the achievement, citing verifiability issues, he received the ""guinness world records"" title for most goals scored in a calendar year. as the odds-on favourite, messi again won the fifa ballon d'or, becoming the only player in history to win the ballon d'or four times.

barcelona had virtually secured their la liga title by the start of 2013, eventually equalling real madrid's 100-point record of the previous season. however, their performances deteriorated in the second half of the 2012â13 campaign, concurrently with vilanova's absence due to ill health. after losing successive ""clã¡sicos"", including the copa del rey semi-finals, they were nearly eliminated in the first knockout round of the champions league by milan, but a revival of form in the second leg led to a 4â0 comeback, with two goals and an assist from messi. now in his ninth senior season with barcelona, messi signed a new contract on 7 february, committing himself to the club through 2018, while his fixed wage rose to â¬13â million. he wore the captain's armband for the first time a month later, on 17 march, in a league match against rayo vallecano; by then, he had become the team's tactical focal point to a degree that was arguably rivalled only by former barcelona players josep samitier, lã¡szlã³ kubala and johan cruyff. since his evolution into a false nine three years earlier, his input into the team's attack had increased exponentially; from 24% in their treble-winning campaign, his goal contribution rose to more than 40% that season.

after four largely injury-free seasons, the muscular injuries that had previously plagued messi reoccurred. after he suffered a hamstring strain on 2 april, during the first quarter-final against paris saint-germain, his appearances became sporadic. in the second leg against psg, with an underperforming barcelona down a goal, messi came off the bench in the second half and within nine minutes helped create their game-tying goal, which allowed them to progress to the semi-finals. still unfit, he proved ineffective during the first leg against bayern munich and was unable to play at all during the second, as barcelona were defeated 7â0 on aggregate by the eventual champions. these matches gave credence to the notion of ""messidependencia"", barcelona's perceived tactical and psychological dependence on their star player.

messi continued to struggle with injury throughout 2013, eventually parting ways with his long-time personal physiotherapist. further damage to his hamstring sustained on 12 may ended his goalscoring streak of 21 consecutive league games, a worldwide record; he had netted 33 goals during his run, including a four-goal display against osasuna, while becoming the first player to score consecutively against all 19 opposition teams in la liga. with 60 goals in all competitions, including 46 goals in la liga, he finished the campaign as league top scorer in spain and europe for the second consecutive year, becoming the first player in history to win the european golden shoe three times. following an irregular start to the new season under manager gerardo martino, formerly of his boyhood club newell's old boys, messi suffered his fifth injury of 2013 when he tore his hamstring on 10 november, leaving him sidelined for two months. despite his injuries, he was voted runner-up for the fifa ballon d'or, relinquishing the award after a four-year monopoly to cristiano ronaldo.

during the second half of the 2013â14 season, doubts persisted over messi's form, leading to a perception among the ""culã©s"" that he was reserving himself for the 2014 fifa world cup. statistically, his contribution of goals, shots, and passes had dropped significantly compared to previous seasons. he still managed to break two longstanding records in a span of seven days: a hat-trick on 16 march against osasuna saw him overtake paulino alcã¡ntara's 369 goals to become barcelona's top goalscorer in all competitions including friendlies, while another hat-trick against real madrid on 23 march made him the all-time top scorer in ""el clã¡sico"", ahead of the 18 goals scored by former real madrid player alfredo di stã©fano. messi finished the campaign with his worst output in five seasons, though he still managed to score 41 goals in all competitions. for the first time in five years, barcelona ended the season without a major trophy; they were defeated in the copa del rey final by real madrid and lost the league in the last game to atlã©tico madrid, causing messi to be booed by sections of fans at the camp nou. after prolonged speculation over his future with the club, messi signed a new contract on 19 may 2014, only a year after his last contractual update; his salary increased to â¬20â million, or â¬36â million before taxes, the highest wage in the sport.

under new manager and former captain luis enrique, messi experienced a largely injury-free start to the 2014â15 season, allowing him to break three more longstanding records towards the end of the year. a hat-trick scored against sevilla on 22 november made him the all-time top scorer in la liga, as he surpassed the 59-year record of 251 league goals held by telmo zarra. a third hat-trick, scored against city rivals espanyol on 7 december, allowed him to surpass cã©sar rodrã­guez as the all-time top scorer in the ""derbi barcelonã­"" with 12 goals. messi again placed second in the fifa ballon d'or behind cristiano ronaldo, largely owing to his second-place achievement with argentina at the world cup.

at the start of 2015, barcelona were perceived to be headed for another disappointing end to the season, with renewed speculation in the media that messi was leaving the club. a turning point came on 11 january during a 3â1 victory over atlã©tico madrid, the first time barã§a's attacking trident of messi, luis suã¡rez and neymar, dubbed ""msn"", each scored in a match, marking the beginning of a highly successful run. after five years of playing in the centre of the pitch, messi had returned to his old position on the right wing late the previous year, by his own suggestion according to suã¡rez, their striker. from there, he regained his best â arguably his best-ever â form, while suã¡rez and neymar ended the team's attacking dependency on their star player. with 58 goals from messi, the trio scored a total of 122 goals in all competitions that season, a record in spanish football.
towards the end of the campaign, messi scored in a 1â0 away win over atlã©tico madrid on 17 may, securing the la liga title. among his 43 league goals that season was a hat-trick scored in 11 minutes against rayo vallecano on 8 march, the fastest of his senior career; it was his 32nd hat-trick overall for barcelona, allowing him to overtake telmo zarra with the most hat-tricks in spanish football. as the season's top assist provider with 18 he surpassed luã­s figo with the most assists in la liga; he made his record 106th assist in a fixture against levante on 15 february, in which he also scored a hat-trick. messi scored twice as barcelona defeated athletic bilbao 3â1 in the copa del rey final on 30 may, achieving the sixth double in their history. his opening goal was hailed as one of the greatest in his career; he collected the ball near the halfway line and beat four opposing players, before feinting the goalkeeper to score in a tight space by the near post.

in the champions league, messi scored twice and assisted on another in their 3â0 semi-final victory over bayern munich, now under the stewardship of guardiola. his second goal, which came only three minutes after his first, saw him chip the ball over goalkeeper manuel neuer after his dribble past jã©rã´me boateng had made the defender drop to the ground; it went viral, becoming the year's most tweeted about sporting moment, and was named the best goal of the season by uefa. despite a second-leg loss, barcelona progressed to the final on 6 june in berlin, where they defeated juventus 3â1 to win their second treble, becoming the first team in history to do so. although messi did not score, he participated in each of his side's goals, particularly the second as he forced a parried save from goalkeeper gianluigi buffon from which suã¡rez scored the match-winning goal on the rebound. in addition to being the top assist provider with six assists, messi finished the competition as the joint top scorer with ten goals, which earned him the distinction of being the first player ever to achieve the top scoring mark in five champions league seasons. for his efforts during the season, he received the uefa best player in europe award for a second time.

messi opened the 2015â16 season by scoring twice from free kicks in barcelona's 5â4 victory (after extra time) over sevilla in the uefa super cup. on 16 september, he became the youngest player to make 100 appearances in the uefa champions league in a 1â1 away draw to roma. after a knee injury, he returned to the pitch on 21 november, making a substitute appearance in barcelona's 4â0 away win over rivals real madrid in ""el clã¡sico"". messi capped off the year by winning the 2015 fifa club world cup final on 20 december, collecting his fifth club trophy of 2015 as barcelona defeated river plate 3â0 in yokohama. on 30 december, messi scored on his 500th appearance for barcelona, in a 4â0 home win over real betis.

messi opened the 2016â17 season by lifting the 2016 supercopa de espaã±a as barcelona's captain in the absence of the injured andrã©s iniesta; he set-up munir's goal in a 2â0 away win over sevilla in the first leg on 14 august, and subsequently scored and assisted in a 3â0 win in the return leg on 17 august. three days later, he scored two goals and provided an assist to lead barcelona to a 6â2 victory against real betis in the opening game of the 2016â17 la liga season. on 13 september 2016, messi scored his first hat-trick of the season in the opening game of the 2016â17 uefa champions league campaign against celtic in a 7â0 victory; this was also messi's sixth hat-trick in the champions league, the most by any player. a week later, messi sustained a groin injury in a 1â1 draw against atlã©tico madrid and was ruled out with injury for three weeks. he marked his return with a goal, scoring three minutes after coming off the bench in a 4â0 home win over deportivo de la coruã±a, on 16 october. three days after this, he netted his thirty-seventh club hat-trick as barcelona defeated manchester city 4â0. on 1 november, messi scored his 54th champions league group stage goal in barcelona's 3â1 away loss to manchester city, surpassing the previous record of 53 goals held by raãºl.
messi finished the year with 51 goals, making him europe's top scorer, one ahead of zlatan ibrahimoviä. after placing second in the 2016 ballon d'or, on 9 january 2017 messi also finished in second place â behind cristiano ronaldo once again â in the 2016 best fifa men's player award. on 11 january, messi scored from a free-kick in barcelona's 3â1 victory against athletic bilbao in the second leg of the round of 16 of the copa del rey, which enabled barcelona to advance to the quarter-finals of the competition; with his 26th goal from a free-kick for barcelona in all competitions, he equalled the club's all-time record, which had previously been set by ronald koeman. in his next league match, on 14 january, messi scored in a 5â0 win against las palmas; with this goal, he equalled raãºl's record for the most number of teams scored against in la liga (35).

messi opened the 2017â18 season by converting a penalty in barcelona's 1â3 first leg home defeat to real madrid in supercopa de espaã±a. thereby, messi also extended his el clã¡sico goalscoring record with the goal being his 24th official and 25th overall.
on 9 september, messi scored his first hat-trick of the 2017â18 league campaign, against espanyol in derbi barcelonã­, thus helping to secure a 5â0 home victory for blaugrana over local rivals. messi netted twice against gianluigi buffon, on 12 september, as ""barã§a"" defeated the last season's italian champions juventus 3â0 at home in the uefa champions league. on 19 september, messi found the net four times in a 6â1 trashing of eibar at the camp nou in la liga. three weeks later, on 1 october, messi surpassed his former teammate carles puyol to become the third highest appearance maker in the club's history, as he helped ""barã§a"" defeat las palmas 3â0 by assisting sergio busquets' opener and later adding two himself in his 594th official game for the club; the league game was played behind closed doors at the camp nou due to violence in catalonia relating to an ongoing independence referendum.

on 18 october, in his 122nd european club appearance, messi scored his 97th uefa champions league goal, and his 100th in all uefa club competitions, in a 3â1 home victory over olympiakos. messi became only the second player after cristiano ronaldo to reach this century milestone, but accomplished it in 21 fewer appearances than the portuguese counterpart. on 4 november, he made his 600th appearance for barcelona in a 2â1 home win over sevilla in la liga. following the reception of his fourth golden boot, messi signed a new deal with barcelona on 25 november, keeping him with the club through the 2020â21 season. his buyout clause was set at â¬700 million. on 7 january 2018, messi made his 400th la liga appearance with barcelona in a 3â0 home win over levante, marking the occasion with his 144th league assist and 365th league goal for the club, the latter of which saw him equal gerd mã¼ller's record for the most league goals scored for the same club in one of europe's top five divisions. a week later, he broke the record, scoring his 366th la liga goal from a free kick in a 4â2 away win against real sociedad.

on 4 march, he scored his 600th senior career goal from a free kick in a 1â0 home win over atlã©tico madrid, in la liga. on 14 march, messi scored his 99th and 100th champions league goals in a 3â0 home win over chelsea, becoming only the second player after cristiano ronaldo to reach this landmark, and achieving it at a younger age, in fewer appearances, having played fewer minutes, and having taken fewer shots than his portuguese counterpart. his opening goal, which came after only two minutes and eight seconds, was also the fastest of his career, as barcelona advanced to the quarter-finals of the competition for the eleventh consecutive season. on 7 april, he scored a hat-trick in a 3â1 win over leganã©s including his sixth goal scored from a free-kick for the season, matching the record set by former teammate ronaldinho. he once again finished the season as the top scorer in la liga, with 34 goals, which also saw him win his fifth golden shoe award. on 21 april, messi scored barcelona's second goal â his 40th of the season â in a 5â0 win over sevilla in the 2018 copa del rey final, later also setting up suã¡rez's second goal; this was barcelona's fourth consecutive title and their 30th overall. on 29 april, messi scored a hat-trick in a 4â2 away win over deportivo de la coruã±a, which saw barcelona claim their 25th league title. on 9 may, messi scored as barcelona defeated villarreal 5â1 to set the longest unbeaten streak (43 games) in la liga history.

with the departure of former captain andrã©s iniesta in may 2018, messi was named the team's new captain for the following season. on 12 august 2018, he lifted his first title as barcelona's captain, the supercopa de espaã±a, following a 2â1 victory over sevilla. on 19 august, messi scored twice in helping barcelona defeat alavã©s 3â0 in their first la liga match of the season, with his first goal, a free kick that he rolled under the jumping alavã©s wall, making history in being barcelona's 6000th goal in la liga. on 18 september, messi scored a hat-trick in a 4â0 home win over psv eindhoven in barcelona's opening champions league group stage match of the season, setting a new record for most hat-tricks in the competition, with eight. on 20 october, messi scored and assisted in a 4â2 home win over sevilla, but was later forced off in the 26th minute after falling awkwardly and injuring his right arm; tests later confirmed that he had fractured his radial bone, ruling him out for approximately three weeks. on 8 december, messi scored two free kicks â his ninth and tenth goals from set pieces during the calendar year â in a 4â0 away win over catalan derby rivals espanyol in la liga; this was the first time ever that he had managed such a feat in the league. his first goal was also his 10th league goal of the season, making him the first player ever to reach double figures in la liga for 13 consecutive seasons.

on 13 january 2019, messi scored his 400th la liga goal in his 435th league appearance in a 3â0 home win over eibar, becoming the first player ever to manage this tally in just one of europe's top five leagues. on 2 february, messi scored twice in a 2â2 draw against valencia, with his first goal coming from the penalty spot, his 50th la liga penalty goal; as such, he became only the third player in la liga history after cristiano ronaldo and hugo sã¡nchez to score 50 penalties in the competition. later that month, the club admitted they had begun preparations for messi's future retirement. on 23 february, messi scored the 50th hat-trick of his career and also provided an assist for suã¡rez, as he helped barcelona come from behind to achieve a 4â2 away victory over sevilla in la liga; the goal was also his 650th career goal for club and country at senior level. on 16 april, messi scored twice in a 3â0 home victory over manchester united in the second leg of the champions league quarter-finals to give barcelona a 4â0 aggregate win, which saw barcelona progress to the semi-finals of the competition for the first time since 2015; these were also his first goals in the champions league quarter-finals since 2013.

on 27 april, messi came off the bench and scored the only goal in a 1â0 home win over levante, which allowed barcelona to clinch the league title; this was his 450th la liga appearance, and his first league title as barcelona's captain. on 1 may, messi scored twice in a 3â0 home win over liverpool in the first leg of the champions league semi-finals; his second goal of the match, a 35-yard free kick, was the 600th senior club goal of his career, all of which had been scored with barcelona. in the return leg six days later at anfield, barcelona suffered a 4â0 away defeat, which saw liverpool advance to the final 4â3 on aggregate. on 19 may, in barcelona's final la liga match of the season, messi scored twice in a 2â2 away draw against eibar (his 49th and 50th goals of the season in all competitions), which saw him capture his sixth pichichi trophy as the league's top scorer, with 36 goals in 34 appearances; with six titles, he equalled zarra as the player with the most top-scorer awards in la liga. he also captured his sixth golden shoe award, and a record third consecutive award since the 2016â17 season. on 25 may, messi scored his final goal of the season in a 2â1 defeat to valencia in the 2019 copa del rey final.

on 5 august 2019, it was announced that messi would miss barcelona's us tour after sustaining a right calf injury. on 19 august, messi's chipped goal from the edge of the box against real betis was nominated for the 2019 fifa puskã¡s award. later that month, he suffered another setback following the return of his calf injury, which ruled him out of the opening game of the season; as a result, he was sidelined indefinitely, and was only expected to return to action with barcelona after the september international break. on 2 september, messi was shortlisted as one of the three finalists for both the 2019 fifa puskã¡s award and the 2019 best fifa men's player award, with messi winning the latter on 23 september. he made his first appearance of the season on 17 september, and on 6 october he scored his first goal of the season with a free kick in a 4â0 home win over sevilla; this was his 420th goal in la liga, which saw him break cristiano ronaldo's record of 419 goals scored in europe's top five leagues.

as a dual argentine-spanish national, messi was eligible to play for the national team of both countries. selectors for spain's under-17 squad began pursuing him in 2003 after barcelona's director of football, carles rexach, alerted the royal spanish football federation to their young player. messi declined the offer, having aspired to represent ""la albiceleste"" since childhood. to further prevent spain from taking him, the argentine football association organised two under-20 friendlies in june 2004, against paraguay and uruguay, with the purpose of finalising his status as an argentina player in fifa. five days after his 17th birthday, on 29 june, he made his debut for his country against paraguay, scoring once and providing two assists in their 8â0 victory. he was subsequently included in the squad for the south american youth championship, held in colombia in february 2005. as he lacked the stamina of his teammates, the result of his former growth hormone deficiency, he was used as a substitute in six of the nine games. after being named man of the match against venezuela, he scored the winning 2â1 goal in the crucial last match against brazil, thereby securing their third-place qualification for the fifa world youth championship.

aware of his physical limitations, messi employed a personal trainer to increase his muscle mass, returning to the squad in an improved condition in time for the world youth championship, hosted by the netherlands in june 2005. after he was left out of the starting line-up in their first match against the united states, a 1â0 defeat, the squad's senior players asked manager francisco ferraro to let messi start, as they considered him their best player. after helping the team defeat egypt and germany to progress past the group stage, messi proved decisive in the knockout phase as he scored their equaliser against colombia, provided a goal and an assist against title favourites spain, and scored their opening goal against reigning champions brazil. ahead of the final, he was awarded the golden ball as the best player of the tournament. he scored two penalties in their 2â1 victory over nigeria, clinching argentina's fifth championship and finishing the tournament as top scorer with 6 goals. his performances drew comparisons with compatriot diego maradona, who had led argentina to the title in 1979.

in recognition of his achievements with the under-20 side, senior manager josã© pã©kerman gave messi his first call-up for a friendly against hungary on 17 august 2005. aged 18, messi made his senior debut for argentina in the ferenc puskã¡s stadium when he came on in the 63rd minute, only to be sent off after two minutes for a perceived foul against vilmos vanczã¡k, who had grabbed his shirt; messi had struck the defender with his arm while trying to shake him off, which the referee interpreted as an intentional elbowing, a contentious decision. messi was reportedly found weeping in the dressing room after his sending-off. he returned to the team on 3 september in their world cup qualifier defeat to paraguay, which he had declared his ""re-debut"" ahead of the match. messi started his first game in the next qualifying match against peru, in which he was able to win a crucial penalty that secured their victory. after the match, pã©kerman described him as ""a jewel"". he subsequently made regular appearances for the team ahead of argentina's participation in the 2006 fifa world cup, scoring his first goal in a friendly against croatia on 1 march 2006. a hamstring injury sustained a week later jeopardised his presence in the world cup, but he was nevertheless selected for pã©kerman's squad and regained fitness in time for the start of the tournament.

during the world cup in germany, messi witnessed their opening match victory against the ivory coast from the substitutes' bench. in the next match, against serbia and montenegro, he became the youngest player to represent argentina at a fifa world cup when he came on as a substitute in the 74th minute. he assisted their fourth strike within minutes and scored the final goal in their 6â0 victory, making him the youngest scorer in the tournament and the sixth-youngest goalscorer in the history of the world cup. as their progression to the knockout phase was secured, several starters were rested during the last group match. messi consequently started the game against the netherlands, a 0â0 draw, as they won their group on goal differential. in the round of 16 match against mexico, played on his 19th birthday, messi came on in the 84th minute, with the score tied at 1â1. he appeared to score a goal, but it was contentiously ruled offside, with the team needing a late goal in extra time to proceed. he did not play in the quarter-final against germany, during which argentina were eliminated 4â2 in a penalty shootout. back home, pã©kerman's decision to leave him on the bench against germany led to widespread criticism from those who believed messi could have changed the outcome of the match in argentina's favour.

as messi evolved into one of the best players in the world, he secured a place in alfio basile's starting line-up, as part of a team considered favourites to win the 2007 copa amã©rica, held in venezuela. he set up the game-winning goal of their 4â1 victory over the united states in the opening match, before winning a penalty that led to the game-tying first strike of their 4â2 win in the next match against colombia. as they had secured their place in the knockout phase, messi started the next game on the bench, coming on in the last 25 minutes with the score at 0â0 to help his team defeat paraguay by assisting their only goal. at the quarter-final stage, where the group winners faced peru, he scored the second goal of a 4â0 victory that saw them through to the semi-final, during which he chipped the ball over mexico's goalkeeper to ensure another 3â0 win. in a surprise defeat, argentina lost the final 3â0 to a brazil squad that lacked several of the nation's best players. their unexpected loss was followed by much criticism in argentina, though messi was mostly exempt due to his young age and secondary status to star player juan romã¡n riquelme. he was named the best young player of the tournament by conmebol.

ahead of the 2008 summer olympics, barcelona legally barred messi from representing argentina at the tournament as it coincided with their champions league qualifying matches. after interference from newly appointed barcelona manager pep guardiola, who had won the tournament in 1992, messi was permitted to join sergio batista's under-23 squad in beijing. during the first match, he scored the opening goal and assisted another in their 2â1 victory over the ivory coast. following a 1â0 win in the next group match against australia, ensuring their quarter-final qualification, messi was rested during the game against serbia, while his side won the match to finish first in their group. against the netherlands, he again scored the first goal and assisted a second strike to help his team to a 2â1 win in extra time. after a 3â0 semi-final victory over brazil, messi assisted the only goal in the final as argentina defeated nigeria to claim olympic gold medals. along with riquelme, messi was singled out by fifa as the stand-out player from the tournament's best team.

from late 2008, the national team experienced a three-year period marked by poor performances. under manager diego maradona, who had led argentina to world cup victory as a player, the team struggled to qualify for the 2010 world cup, securing their place in the tournament only after defeating uruguay 1â0 in their last qualifying match. maradona was criticised for his strategic decisions, which included playing messi out of his usual position. in eight qualifying matches under maradona's stewardship, messi scored only one goal, netting the opening goal in the first such match, a 4â0 victory over venezuela. during that game, played on 28 march 2009, he wore argentina's number 10 shirt for the first time, following the international retirement of riquelme. overall, messi scored four goals in 18 appearances during the qualifying process. ahead of the tournament, maradona visited messi in barcelona to request his tactical input; messi then outlined a 4â3â1â2 formation with himself playing behind the two strikers, a playmaking position known as the ""enganche"" in argentine football, which had been his preferred position since childhood.

despite their poor qualifying campaign, argentina were considered title contenders at the world cup in south africa. at the start of the tournament, the new formation proved effective; messi managed at least four attempts on goal during their opening match but was repeatedly denied by nigeria's goalkeeper, resulting in a 1â0 win. during the next match, against south korea, he excelled in his playmaking role, participating in all four goals of his side's 4â1 victory. as their place in the knockout phase was guaranteed, most of the starters were rested during the last group match, but messi reportedly refused to be benched. he wore the captain's armband for the first time in their 2â0 win against greece; as the focal point of their play, he helped create their second goal to see argentina finish as group winners. in the round of 16, they defeated mexico 3â1, with messi assisting their first goal, a controversial strike that stood despite being offside.

argentina were eliminated in the quarter-final against germany, at the same stage of the tournament and by the same opponent as four years earlier. their 4â0 loss was their worst margin of defeat since 1974. fifa subsequently identified messi as one of the tournament's 10 best players, citing his ""outstanding"" pace and creativity and ""spectacular and efficient"" dribbling, shooting and passing. back home, however, messi was the subject of harsher judgement. as the perceived best player in the world, he had been expected to lead an average team to the title, as maradona arguably did in 1986, but he had failed to replicate his performances at barcelona with the national team, leading to the accusation that he cared less about his country than his club.

maradona was replaced by sergio batista, who had orchestrated argentina's olympic victory. batista publicly stated that he intended to build the team around messi, employing him as a false nine within a 4â3â3 system, as used to much success by barcelona. although messi scored a record 53 goals during the 2010â11 club season, he had not scored for argentina in an official match since march 2009. despite the tactical change, his goal drought continued during the 2011 copa amã©rica, hosted by argentina. their first two matches, against bolivia and colombia, ended in draws. media and fans noted that he did not combine well with striker carlos tevez, who enjoyed greater popularity among the argentine public; messi was consequently booed by his own team's supporters for the first time in his career. during the crucial next match, with tevez on the bench, he gave a well-received performance, assisting two goals in their 3â0 victory over costa rica. after the quarter-final against uruguay ended in a 1â1 draw following extra time, with messi having assisted their equaliser, argentina were eliminated 4â5 in the penalty shootout by the eventual champions.

after argentina's unsuccessful performance in the copa amã©rica, batista was replaced by alejandro sabella. upon his appointment in august 2011, sabella awarded the 24-year-old messi the captaincy of the squad, in accord with then-captain javier mascherano. reserved by nature, messi went on to lead his squad by example as their best player, while mascherano continued to fulfil the role of the team's on-field leader and motivator. in a further redesign of the team, sabella dismissed tevez and brought in players with whom messi had won the world youth championship and olympic games. now playing in a free role in an improving team, messi ended his goal drought by scoring during their first world cup qualifying match against chile on 7 october, his first official goal for argentina in two-and-a-half years.

under sabella, messi's goalscoring rate drastically increased; where he had scored only 17 goals in 61 matches under his previous managers, he scored 25 times in 32 appearances during the following three years. he netted a total of 12 goals in 9 games for argentina in 2012, equalling the record held by gabriel batistuta, argentina's all-time top scorer, for the most goals scored in a calendar year for their country. his first hat-trick with the ""albicelestes"" came in a friendly against switzerland on 29 february 2012, followed by two more hat-tricks over the next year-and-a-half in friendlies against brazil and guatemala. messi then helped the team secure their place in the 2014 world cup with a 5â2 victory over paraguay on 10 september 2013; in addition to providing an assist, he scored twice from a penalty kick, taking his international tally to 37 goals to become argentina's second-highest goalscorer behind batistuta. overall, he had scored a total of 10 goals in 14 matches during the qualifying campaign. concurrently with his bettered performances, his relationship with his compatriots improved, as he gradually began to be perceived more favourably in argentina.

ahead of the world cup in brazil, doubts persisted over messi's form, as he finished an unsuccessful and injury-plagued season with barcelona. at the start of the tournament, however, he gave strong performances, being elected man of the match in their first four matches. in his first world cup match as captain, he led them to a 2â1 victory over bosnia and herzegovina; he helped create sead kolaå¡inac's own goal and scored their second strike after a dribble past three players, his first world cup goal since his debut in the tournament eight years earlier. during the second match against iran, he scored an injury-time goal from out to end the game in a 1â0 win, securing their qualification for the knockout phase. he scored twice in the last group match, a 3â2 victory over nigeria, his second goal from a free kick, as they finished first in their group. messi assisted a late goal in extra time to ensure a 1â0 win against switzerland in the round of 16, before starting the play that led to their match-winning 1â0 goal in the quarter-final against belgium, helping argentina progress to the semi-final of the world cup for the first time since 1990. following a 0â0 draw in extra time, they eliminated the netherlands 4â2 in a penalty shootout to reach the final, with messi scoring his team's first penalty.

billed as messi versus germany, the world's best player against the best team, the final was a repeat of the 1990 final featuring diego maradona. within the first half-hour, messi had started the play that led to a goal, but it was ruled offside. he missed several opportunities to open the scoring throughout the match, in particular at the start of the second half when his breakaway effort went wide of the far post. substitute mario gã¶tze finally scored in the 113th minute, followed in the last minute of extra time by a free kick that messi sent over the net, as germany won the match 1â0 to claim the world cup. at the conclusion of the final, messi was awarded the golden ball as the best player of the tournament. in addition to being the joint third-highest goalscorer, with four goals and an assist, he created the most chances, completed the most dribbling runs, made the most deliveries into the penalty area and produced the most throughballs in the competition. however, his selection drew criticism due to his lack of goals in the knockout round; fifa president sepp blatter expressed his surprise, while maradona suggested that messi had undeservedly been chosen for marketing purposes.

another final appearance, the third of messi's senior international career, followed in the 2015 copa amã©rica, held in chile. under the stewardship of former barcelona manager gerardo martino, argentina entered the tournament as title contenders due to their second-place achievement at the world cup. during the opening match against paraguay, they were ahead two goals by half-time but lost their lead to end the match in a 2â2 draw; messi had scored from a penalty kick, netting his only goal in the tournament. following a 1â0 win against defending champions uruguay, messi earned his 100th cap for his country in the final group match, a 1â0 win over jamaica, becoming only the fifth argentine to achieve this milestone. in his 100 appearances, he had scored a total of 46 goals for argentina, 22 of which came in official competitive matches.

as messi evolved from the team's symbolic captain into a genuine leader, he led argentina to the knockout stage as group winners. in the quarter-final, they created numerous chances, including a rebound header by messi, but were repeatedly denied by colombia's goalkeeper, and ultimately ended the match scoreless, leading to a 5â4 penalty shootout in their favour, with messi netting his team's first spot kick. at the semi-final stage, messi excelled as playmaker as he provided three assists and helped create three more goals in his side's 6â1 victory over paraguay, receiving applause from the initially hostile crowd. argentina started the final as the odds-on title favourites, but were defeated by chile 4â1 in a penalty shootout after an 0â0 extra-time draw. faced with aggression from opposing players, including taking a boot to the midriff, messi played below his standards, though he was the only argentine to successfully convert his penalty. at the close of the tournament, he was reportedly selected to receive the most valuable player award but rejected the honour. as argentina continued a trophy drought that began in 1993, the world cup and copa amã©rica defeats again brought intense criticism for messi from argentine media and fans.

messi's place in argentina's copa amã©rica centenario squad was initially put in jeopardy when he sustained a back injury in a 1â0 friendly win over honduras in a pre-copa amã©rica warm-up match on 27 may 2016. it was later reported that he had suffered a deep bruise in his lumbar region. he was later left on the bench in argentina's 2â1 opening win over defending champions chile on 6 june due to concerns regarding his fitness. although messi was declared match-fit for his nation's second group match against panama on 10 june, martino left him on the bench once again; he replaced augusto fernã¡ndez in the 61st minute and subsequently scored a hat-trick in 19 minutes, also starting the play which led to sergio agã¼ero's goal, as the match ended in a 5â0 victory, sealing argentina's place in the quarter-finals of the competition; he was elected man of the match for his performance.
on 18 june 2016, in the quarter-final of the copa amã©rica against venezuela, messi produced another man of the match performance, assisting two goals and scoring another in a 4â1 victory, which enabled him to equal gabriel batistuta's national record of 54 goals in official international matches. this record was broken three days later when messi scored in a 4â0 win in the semi-final of the copa amã©rica against hosts the united states; he also assisted two goals during the match as argentina sealed a place in the final of the competition for a second consecutive year, and was named man of the match once again.

during a repeat of the previous year's final on 26 june, argentina once again lost to chile on penalties after a 0â0 deadlock, resulting in messi's third consecutive defeat in a major tournament final with argentina, and his fourth overall. after the match, messi, who had missed his penalty in the shootout, announced his retirement from international football. he stated, ""i tried my hardest. the team has ended for me, a decision made."" chile coach juan antonio pizzi said after the match, ""my generation can't compare him to maradona that's for my generation, because of what maradona did for argentine football. but i think the best player ever played today here in the united states."" messi finished the tournament as the second highest scorer, behind eduardo vargas, with five goals, and was the highest assist provider with four assists, also winning more man of the match awards than any other player in the tournament (3); he was named to the team of the tournament for his performances, but missed out on the golden ball award for best player, which went to alexis sã¡nchez.

following his announcement, a campaign began in argentina for messi to change his mind about retiring. he was greeted by fans with signs like ""don't go, leo"" when the team landed in buenos aires. president of argentina mauricio macri urged messi not to quit, stating, ""we are lucky, it is one of life's pleasures, it is a gift from god to have the best player in the world in a footballing country like ours... lionel messi is the greatest thing we have in argentina and we must take care of him."" mayor of buenos aires horacio rodrã­guez larreta unveiled a statue of messi in the capital to convince him to reconsider retirement. on social networks, ""notevayasleo"" became a global trending topic, and even a playlist on spotify. the campaign also continued in the streets and avenues of the argentine capital, with about 50,000 supporters going to the obelisco de buenos aires on 2 july, using the same slogan.

just a week after messi announced his international retirement, argentine newspaper ""la naciã³n"" reported that he was reconsidering playing for argentina at the 2018 fifa world cup qualifiers in september. on 12 august, it was confirmed that messi had reversed his decision to retire from international football, and he was included in the squad for the national team's upcoming 2018 world cup qualifiers. on 1 september 2016, in his first game back, he scored in a 1â0 home win over uruguay in a 2018 world cup qualifier.

on 28 march 2017, messi was suspended for four international games for insulting an assistant referee in a game against chile on 23 march 2017. he was also fined chf 10,000. on 5 may 2017, messi's four match ban as well as his 10,000 chf fine was lifted by fifa after argentina football association appealed against his suspension, which meant he could now play argentina's remaining world cup qualifiers. argentina's place in the 2018 world cup was in jeopardy going into their final qualifying match as they were sixth in their group, outside the five possible conmebol world cup qualifying spots, meaning they risked failing to qualify for the world cup for the first time since 1970. on 10 october 2017, messi led his country to world cup qualification in scoring a hat-trick as argentina came from behind to defeat ecuador 3â1 away; argentina had not defeated ecuador in quito since 2001. messi's three goals saw him become the joint all-time leading scorer in conmebol world cup qualifiers with 21 goals, alongside uruguay's luis suã¡rez, overtaking the previous record which was held by compatriot hernã¡n crespo.

following on from their poor qualification campaign, salvaged by messi, expectations were not high going into the 2018 world cup, with the team, without an injured messi, losing 6â1 to spain in march 2018. prior to argentina's opener, there was speculation in the media over whether this would be messi's final world cup. in the team's opening group match against iceland on 16 june, messi missed a potential match-winning penalty in an eventual 1â1 draw. in argentina's second game of the 2018 world cup on 21 june, the team lost 3â0 to croatia. post match the argentina coach jorge sampaoli spoke of the lack of quality in the team surrounding messi, ""the reality of the argentina squad clouds his [messi's] brilliance"". messi had just 49 touches of the ball and only two inside the croatia penalty area. sampaoli stated, ""we quite simply couldn't pass to him to help him generate the situations he is used to. we worked to give him the ball but the opponent also worked hard to prevent him from getting the ball. we lost that battle."" croatia midfielder luka modriä also stated post match, ""messi is an incredible player but he can't do everything alone.""
in argentina's final group match against nigeria at the krestovsky stadium, saint petersburg on 26 june, messi scored the opening goal in an eventual 2â1 victory, becoming the third argentine after diego maradona and gabriel batistuta to score in three different world cups; he also became the first player to score in the world cup in his teens, twenties, and his thirties. a goal of the tournament contender, messi received a long pass from midfield and controlled the ball on the run with two touches before striking it across goal into the net with his weaker right foot. argentina progressed to the second round as group runners-up behind croatia. in the round of 16 match against eventual champions france on 30 june, messi set up gabriel mercado's and sergio agã¼ero's goals in a 4â3 defeat, which saw argentina eliminated from the world cup. with his two assists in his team's second round fixture, messi became the first player to provide an assist in the last four world cups, and also became the first player to provide two assists in a match for argentina since diego maradona had managed the same feat against south korea in 1986.

following the tournament, messi stated that he would not participate in argentina's friendlies against guatemala and colombia in september 2018, and commented that it would be unlikely that he would represent his nation for the remainder of the calendar year. messi's absence from the national team and his continued failure to win a title with argentina prompted speculation in the media that messi might retire from international football once again. in march 2019, however, he was called up to the argentina squad once again for the team's friendlies against venezuela and morocco later that month. he made his international return on 22 march, in a 3â1 friendly defeat to venezuela, in madrid.

on 21 may 2019, messi was included in lionel scaloni's final 23-man argentina squad for the 2019 copa amã©rica. in argentina's second group match of the tournament on 19 june, messi scored the equalising goal from the penalty spot in a 1â1 draw against paraguay. after coming under criticism in the media over his performance following argentina's 2â0 victory over venezuela in the quarter-finals at the maracanã£ stadium on 28 june, messi commented that it had not been his best copa amã©rica, while also criticising the poor quality of the pitches. following argentina's 2â0 defeat to hosts brazil in the semi-finals on 2 july, messi was critical of the refereeing during the match. in the third-place match against chile on 6 july, messi set-up agã¼ero's opening goal from a free kick in an eventual 2â1 win, to help argentina capture the bronze medal; however, he was sent off along with gary medel in the 37th minute of play, after being involved in an altercation with the chilean. following the match, messi refused to collect his medal, and implied in a post-match interview that his comments following the semi-final led to his sending off. messi later issued an apology for his comments, but was fined $1,500 and was handed a one-match ban by conmebol, which ruled him out of argentina's next world cup qualifier. on 2 august, messi was banned for three months from international football and was fined $50,000 by conmebol for his comments against the referee's decisions; this ban meant he would miss argentina's friendly matches against chile, mexico and germany in september and october.

due to his short stature, messi has a lower centre of gravity than taller players, which gives him greater agility, allowing him to change direction more quickly and evade opposing tackles; this has led the spanish media to dub him ""la pulga atã³mica"" (""the atomic flea""). despite being physically unimposing, he possesses significant upper-body strength, which, combined with his low centre of gravity and resulting balance, aids him in withstanding physical challenges from opponents; he has consequently been noted for his lack of diving in a sport rife with playacting. his short, strong legs allow him to excel in short bursts of acceleration while his quick feet enable him to retain control of the ball when dribbling at speed. his former barcelona manager pep guardiola once stated, ""messi is the only player that runs faster with the ball than he does without it."" although he has improved his ability with his weaker foot since his mid-20s, messi is predominantly a left-footed player; with the outside of his left foot, he usually begins dribbling runs, while he uses the inside of his foot to finish and provide passes and assists.

one of the most prolific goalscorers and clinical finishers of all time, messi is known for his powerful and accurate striking ability from both inside and outside the area, as well as his positioning, quick reactions, and ability to make attacking runs to beat the defensive line. while he is renowned for his eye for goal, he also functions in a playmaking role, courtesy of his vision and precise passing. moreover, he is an accurate free kick and penalty kick taker, though his ability on penalties has somewhat deteriorated in recent seasons. although his conversion rate from free kicks was initially low towards the beginning of his career, he later developed into one of the best free kick takers in the world, and was even considered by certain pundits to be one of the greatest set piece specialists of all time. messi's pace and technical ability enable him to undertake individual dribbling runs towards goal, in particular during counterattacks, usually starting from the halfway line or the right side of the pitch. widely considered to be the best dribbler in the world, and one of the greatest of all time, with regard to this ability, his former argentina manager diego maradona has said of him, ""the ball stays glued to his foot; i've seen great players in my career, but i've never seen anyone with messi's ball control."" beyond his individual qualities, he is also a well-rounded, hard-working team player, known for his creative combinations, in particular with former barcelona midfielders xavi and andrã©s iniesta.

tactically, messi plays in a free attacking role; a versatile player, he is capable of attacking on either wing or through the centre of the pitch. his favoured position in childhood was the playmaker behind two strikers, known as the ""enganche"" in argentine football, but he began his career in spain as a left-winger or left-sided forward. upon his first-team debut, he was moved onto the right wing by manager frank rijkaard; from this position, he could more easily cut through the defence into the middle of the pitch and curl shots on goal with his left foot, rather than predominantly cross balls for teammates. under guardiola and subsequent managers, he most often played in a false nine role; positioned as a centre-forward or lone striker, he would roam the centre, often moving deep into midfield and drawing defenders with him, in order to create and exploit spaces for passes, other teammates' attacking runs off the ball, messi's own dribbling runs, or combinations with xavi and iniesta. under the stewardship of luis enrique, messi initially returned to playing in the right-sided position that characterised much of his early career in the manager's 4â3â3 formation, while he was increasingly deployed in a deeper, free playmaking role in later seasons. under valverde, messi played in a variety of roles. while he occasionally continued to be deployed in a deeper role, from which he could make runs from behind into the box, or even on the right wing or as a false nine, he was also used in a more offensive, central role in a 4â2â3â1, or as a second striker in a 4â4â2 formation, where he was once again given the licence to drop deep, link-up with midfielders, orchestrate his teams attacking plays, and create chances for his attacking partner suã¡rez.

as his career advanced, and his tendency to dribble diminished slightly with age, messi began to dictate play in deeper areas of the pitch, and developed into one of the best passers and playmakers in world football. his work-rate off the ball and defensive responsibilities also decreased as his career progressed; by covering less ground on the pitch, and instead conserving his energy for short bursts of speed, he was able to improve his efficiency, movement, and positional play, and was also able to avoid muscular injuries, despite often playing a large number of matches throughout a particular season on a consistent basis. indeed, while he was injury-prone in his early career, he was later able to improve his injury record by running less off the ball, and by adopting a stricter diet, training regime, and sleep schedule. with the argentina national team, messi has similarly played anywhere along the frontline; under various managers, he has been employed on the right wing, as a false nine, as an out-and-out striker, in a supporting role alongside another forward, or in a deeper, free creative role as a classic number 10 playmaker or attacking midfielder behind the strikers.

a prodigious talent as a teenager, messi established himself among the world's best players before age 20. diego maradona considered the 18-year-old messi the best player in the world alongside ronaldinho, while the brazilian himself, shortly after winning the ballon d'or, commented, ""i'm not even the best at barã§a,"" in reference to his protã©gã©. four years later, after messi had won his first ballon d'or by a record margin, the public debate regarding his qualities as a player moved beyond his status in contemporary football to the possibility that he was the greatest player in history. an early proponent was his then-manager pep guardiola, who, as early as august 2009, declared messi to be the best player he had ever seen. in the following years, this opinion gained greater acceptance among pundits, managers, former and current players, and by the end of barã§a's second treble-winning season, messi's superiority, ahead of maradona and pelã©, had become the predominant view among insiders in continental europe. a frequent dismissal, however, has centred on the fact that messi has not won the fifa world cup with argentina, leading some in the sport to instead cite him as the best club player in history.throughout his career, messi has been compared with his compatriot diego maradona, due to their similar playing styles as diminutive, left-footed dribblers. initially, he was merely one of many young argentine players, including his boyhood idol pablo aimar, to receive the ""new maradona"" moniker, but as his career progressed, messi proved his similarity beyond all previous contenders, establishing himself as the greatest player argentina had produced since maradona. jorge valdano, who won the 1986 world cup alongside maradona, said in october 2013, ""messi is maradona every day. for the last five years, messi has been the maradona of the world cup in mexico."" cã©sar menotti, who as manager orchestrated their 1978 world cup victory, echoed this sentiment when he opined that messi plays ""at the level of the best maradona"". other notable argentines in the sport, such as osvaldo ardiles, javier zanetti, and diego simeone, have expressed their belief that messi has overtaken maradona as the best player in history.
in argentine society, messi is generally held in lesser esteem than maradona, a consequence of not only his perceived uneven performances with the national team, but also of differences in class, personality, and background. messi is in some ways the antithesis of his predecessor: where maradona was an extroverted, controversial character who rose to greatness from the slums, messi is reserved and unassuming, an unremarkable man outside of football. an enduring mark against him is the fact that, although through no fault of his own, he never proved himself in the argentine primera divisiã³n as an upcoming player, achieving stardom overseas from a young age, while his lack of outward passion for the ""albiceleste"" shirtâhe does not sing the national anthem and is disinclined to emotional displaysâhave in the past led to the false perception that he felt catalan rather than truly argentine. despite having lived in spain since age 13, messi has said: ""argentina is my country, my family, my way of expressing myself. i would change all my records to make the people in my country happy."" moreover, several pundits and footballing figures, including maradona, have also questioned messi's leadership with argentina at times, despite his playing ability. in november 2016, with the argentine football association being run by a fifa committee for emergency due to an economic crisis, it was reported that three of the national team's security staff told messi that they haven't been given their salaries for six months. he stepped in and paid the salaries of the three members.

among his contemporary peers, messi is most often compared and contrasted with portuguese forward cristiano ronaldo, as part of an ongoing rivalry that has been compared to past sports rivalries like the muhammad aliâjoe frazier rivalry in boxing, the bjã¶rn borgâjohn mcenroe rivalry in tennis, and the ayrton sennaâalain prost rivalry from formula one motor racing. although messi has at times denied any rivalry, they are widely believed to push one another in their aim to be the best player in the world: since 2008, both players have won five ballons d'or, with messi winning six fifa world's best player awards to ronaldo's five, and six european golden shoes to ronaldo's four. pundits and fans regularly argue the individual merits of both players; beyond their playing styles, the debate also revolves around their differing physiquesâronaldo is with a muscular buildâand contrasting public personalities, with ronaldo's self-confidence and theatrics a foil to messi's humility. from 2009â10 to 2017â18, messi faced ronaldo at least twice every season in ""el clã¡sico"", which ranks among the world's most viewed annual sports events. off the pitch, ronaldo is his direct competitor in terms of salary, sponsorships, and social media fanbase.

according to ""france football"", messi was the world's highest-paid footballer for five years out of six between 2009 and 2014; he was the first player to exceed the â¬40â million benchmark, with earnings of â¬41â million in 2013, and the â¬50ââ¬60â million points, with income of â¬65â million in 2014. messi was second on ""forbes"" list of the world's highest-paid athletes (after cristiano ronaldo) with income of $81.4 million from his salary and endorsements in 2015â16. in 2018 he was the first player to exceed the â¬100m benchmark for a calendar year, with earnings of â¬126m ($154m) in combined income from salaries, bonuses and endorsements. ""forbes"" ranked him the world's highest-paid athlete in 2019. since 2008, he has been barcelona's highest-paid player, receiving a salary that increased incrementally from â¬7.8â million to â¬13â million over the next five years. signing a new barcelona contract in 2017, he earns $667,000 per week in wages, and barcelona also paid him $59.6 million as a signing on bonus. his buyout clause is set at $835 million (â¬700 million).

in addition to his salary and bonuses, much of his income derives from endorsements; ""sportspro"" has consequently cited him as one of the world's most marketable athletes every year since their research began in 2010. his main sponsor since 2006 is the sportswear company adidas. as barcelona's leading youth prospect, he had been signed with nike since age 14, but transferred to adidas after they successfully challenged their rival's claim to his image rights in court. over time, messi established himself as their leading brand endorser; from 2008, he had a long-running signature collection of adidas f50 boots, and in 2015, he became the first footballer to receive his own sub-brand of adidas boots, the adidas messi. since 2017, messi has worn the latest version of the adidas nemeziz.
as a commercial entity, messi's marketing brand has been based exclusively on his talents and achievements as a player, in contrast to arguably more glamorous players like cristiano ronaldo and david beckham. at the start of his career, he thus mainly held sponsorship contracts with companies that employ sports-oriented marketing, such as adidas, pepsi, and konami. from 2010 onwards, concurrently with his increased achievements as a player, his marketing appeal widened, leading to long-term endorsement deals with luxury brands dolce & gabbana and audemars piguet. messi is also a global brand ambassador for gillette, turkish airlines, ooredoo, and tata motors, among other companies. additionally, messi was the face of konami's video game series ""pro evolution soccer"", appearing on the covers of ""pes 2009"", ""pes 2010,"" ""pes 2011"" and ""pes 2020"". he subsequently signed with rival company ea sports to become the face of their series ""fifa"" and has since appeared on four consecutive covers from ""fifa 13"" to ""fifa 16"". his 'point to the sky' goal celebration first appears in ""fifa 14"".
messi's global popularity and influence are well documented. he was among the ""time"" 100, an annual list of the world's most influential people as published by ""time"", in 2011 and 2012. his fanbase on the social media website facebook is among the largest of all public figures: within seven hours of its launch in april 2011, his facebook page had nearly sevenâ million followers, and by november 2013, he had become only the second sportsperson, after cristiano ronaldo, to amass over 50â million followers. he has over 130 million instagram followers, the second highest for a sportsperson, after cristiano ronaldo. according to a 2014 survey by sports research firm repucom in 15 international markets, messi was familiar to 87% of respondents around the world, of whom 78% perceived him favourably, making him the second-most recognised player globally, behind ronaldo, and the most likable of all contemporary players.

other events have illustrated messi's presence in popular culture. a solid gold replica of his left foot, weighing and valued at $5.25â million, went on sale in japan in march 2013 to raise funds for victims of the 2011 tåhoku earthquake and tsunami. a 2013 turkish airlines advertisement starring messi, in which he engages in a selfie competition with then-los angeles lakers star kobe bryant, was the most-watched ad on youtube in the year of its release, receiving 137â million views, and was subsequently voted the best advertisement of the 2005â15 decade to commemorate youtube's founding. world press photo selected ""the final game"", a photograph of messi facing the world cup trophy after argentina's final defeat to germany, as the best sports image of 2014. ""messi"", a documentary about his life by filmmaker ãlex de la iglesia, premiered at the venice film festival in august 2014. born in a zoo at saransk, mordovia, russia in late 2015, messi, a pet cougar who became popular on social media, was named after the player.

since 2008, messi has been in a relationship with antonella roccuzzo, a fellow native of rosario. he has known roccuzzo since he was five years old, as she is the cousin of his best friend since childhood, lucas scaglia, who is also a football player. after keeping their relationship private for a year, messi first confirmed their romance in an interview in january 2009, before going public a month later during a carnival in sitges after the barcelonaâespanyol derby.

messi and roccuzzo have three sons: thiago (born 2012), mateo (born 2015) and ciro (born 2018). to celebrate his partner's first pregnancy, messi placed the ball under his shirt after scoring in argentina's 4â0 win against ecuador on 2 june 2012, before confirming the pregnancy in an interview two weeks later. thiago was born in barcelona on 2 november 2012, with messi attending the birth after being given permission by barcelona to miss training. he announced his son's arrival on his facebook page, writing, ""today i am the happiest man in the world, my son was born and thanks to god for this gift!"" thiago's name and handprints are tattooed on his left calf. in april 2015, messi confirmed on facebook that they were expecting another child. he missed training ahead of a match against atlã©tico madrid to attend the birth of his second son, mateo, on 11 september 2015 in barcelona. on 30 june 2017, he married roccuzzo at a luxury hotel named hotel city center in rosario with about 260 guests attending his wedding. on 15 october 2017, his wife announced they were expecting their third child in an instagram post, with the words ""family of 5"". on 10 march 2018, messi skipped the match against mã¡laga after ciro was born.

messi enjoys a close relationship with his immediate family members, particularly his mother, celia, whose face he has tattooed on his left shoulder. his professional affairs are largely run as a family business: his father, jorge, has been his agent since he was 14, and his oldest brother, rodrigo, handles his daily schedule and publicity. his mother and other brother, matã­as, manage his charitable organisation, the leo messi foundation, and take care of personal and professional matters in rosario.

since leaving for spain at age 13, messi has maintained close ties to his hometown of rosario, even preserving his distinct rosarino accent. he has kept ownership of his family's old house, although it has long stood empty; he maintains a penthouse apartment in an exclusive residential building for his mother, as well as a family compound just outside the city. once when he was in training with the national team in buenos aires, he made a three-hour trip by car to rosario immediately after practice to have dinner with his family, spent the night with them, and returned to buenos aires the next day in time for practice. messi keeps in daily contact via phone and text with a small group of confidants in rosario, most of whom were fellow members of ""the machine of '87"" at newell's old boys. he currently lives in castelldefels, a village near barcelona. although considered a one-club man, he has long planned to return to rosario to end his playing career at newell's. he was on bad terms with the club after his transfer to barcelona, but by 2012 their public feud had ended, with newell's embracing their ties with messi, even issuing a club membership card to his newborn son.

throughout his career, messi has been involved in charitable efforts aimed at vulnerable children, a commitment that stems in part from the medical difficulties he faced in his own childhood. since 2004, he has contributed his time and finances to the united nations children's fund (unicef), an organisation with which barcelona also have a strong association. messi has served as a unicef goodwill ambassador since his appointment in march 2010, completing his first field mission for the organisation four months later as he travelled to haiti to bring public awareness to the plight of the country's children in the wake of the recent earthquake. he has since participated in unicef campaigns targeting hiv prevention, education, and the social inclusion of disabled children. to celebrate his son's first birthday, in november 2013, messi and thiago were part of a publicity campaign to raise awareness of mortality rates among disadvantaged children.
in addition to his work with unicef, messi founded his own charitable organisation, the leo messi foundation, which supports access to health care, education, and sport for children. it was established in 2007 following a visit messi paid to a hospital for terminally ill children in boston, an experience that resonated with him to the point that he decided to reinvest part of his earnings into society. through his foundation, messi has awarded research grants, financed medical training, and invested in the development of medical centres and projects in argentina, spain, and elsewhere in the world. in addition to his own fundraising activities, such as his global ""messi and friends"" football matches, his foundation receives financial support from various companies to which he has assigned his name in endorsement agreements, with adidas as their main sponsor.

messi has also invested in youth football in argentina: he financially supports sarmiento, a football club based in the rosario neighbourhood where he was born, committing in 2013 to the refurbishment of their facilities and the installation of all-weather pitches, and funds the management of several youth players at newell's old boys and rival club rosario central, as well as at river plate and boca juniors in buenos aires. at newell's old boys, his boyhood club, he funded the 2012 construction of a new gymnasium and a dormitory inside the club's stadium for their youth academy. his former youth coach at newell's, ernesto vecchio, is employed by the leo messi foundation as a talent scout for young players. on 7 june 2016, messi won a libel case against ""la razã³n"" newspaper and was awarded â¬65,000 in damages, which he donated to the charity mã©decins sans frontiã¨res.

messi's financial affairs came under investigation in 2013 for suspected tax evasion. offshore companies in tax havens uruguay and belize were used to evade â¬4.1â million in taxes related to sponsorship earnings between 2007 and 2009. an unrelated shell company in panama, set up in 2012, was subsequently identified as belonging to the messis in the panama papers data leak. messi, who pleaded ignorance of the alleged scheme, voluntarily paid arrears of â¬5.1â million in august 2013. on 6 july 2016, messi and his father were both found guilty of tax fraud and were handed suspended 21-month prison sentences and respectively ordered to pay â¬1.7â million and â¬1.4â million in fines. facing the judge, he said, ""i just played football. i signed the contracts because i trusted my dad and the lawyers and we had decided that they would take charge of those things.""






bibliography
"
isaac newton,"
sir isaac newton (25 december 1642â â 20 march 1726/27) was an english mathematician, physicist, astronomer, theologian, and author (described in his own day as a ""natural philosopher"") who is widely recognised as one of the most influential scientists of all time, and a key figure in the scientific revolution. his book ""philosophiã¦ naturalis principia mathematica"" (""mathematical principles of natural philosophy""), first published in 1687, laid the foundations of classical mechanics. newton also made seminal contributions to optics, and shares credit with gottfried wilhelm leibniz for developing the infinitesimal calculus.

in ""principia"", newton formulated the laws of motion and universal gravitation that formed the dominant scientific viewpoint until it was superseded by the theory of relativity. newton used his mathematical description of gravity to prove kepler's laws of planetary motion, account for tides, the trajectories of comets, the precession of the equinoxes and other phenomena, eradicating doubt about the solar system's heliocentricity. he demonstrated that the motion of objects on earth and celestial bodies could be accounted for by the same principles. newton's inference that the earth is an oblate spheroid was later confirmed by the geodetic measurements of maupertuis, la condamine, and others, convincing most european scientists of the superiority of newtonian mechanics over earlier systems.

newton built the first practical reflecting telescope and developed a sophisticated theory of colour based on the observation that a prism separates white light into the colours of the visible spectrum. his work on light was collected in his highly influential book ""opticks"", published in 1704. he also formulated an empirical law of cooling, made the first theoretical calculation of the speed of sound, and introduced the notion of a newtonian fluid. in addition to his work on calculus, as a mathematician newton contributed to the study of power series, generalised the binomial theorem to non-integer exponents, developed a method for approximating the roots of a function, and classified most of the cubic plane curves.

newton was a fellow of trinity college and the second lucasian professor of mathematics at the university of cambridge. he was a devout but unorthodox christian who privately rejected the doctrine of the trinity. unusually for a member of the cambridge faculty of the day, he refused to take holy orders in the church of england. beyond his work on the mathematical sciences, newton dedicated much of his time to the study of alchemy and biblical chronology, but most of his work in those areas remained unpublished until long after his death. politically and personally tied to the whig party, newton served two brief terms as member of parliament for the university of cambridge, in 1689â90 and 1701â02. he was knighted by queen anne in 1705 and spent the last three decades of his life in london, serving as warden (1696â1700) and master (1700â1727) of the royal mint, as well as president of the royal society (1703â1727).

isaac newton was born (according to the julian calendar, in use in england at the time) on christmas day, 25 december 1642 (ns 4 january 1643) ""an hour or two after midnight"", at woolsthorpe manor in woolsthorpe-by-colsterworth, a hamlet in the county of lincolnshire. his father, also named isaac newton, had died three months before. born prematurely, newton was a small child; his mother hannah ayscough reportedly said that he could have fit inside a quart mug. when newton was three, his mother remarried and went to live with her new husband, the reverend barnabas smith, leaving her son in the care of his maternal grandmother, margery ayscough. newton disliked his stepfather and maintained some enmity towards his mother for marrying him, as revealed by this entry in a list of sins committed up to the age of 19: ""threatening my father and mother smith to burn them and the house over them."" newton's mother had three children from her second marriage.

from the age of about twelve until he was seventeen, newton was educated at the king's school, grantham, which taught latin and greek and probably imparted a significant foundation of mathematics. he was removed from school, and returned to woolsthorpe-by-colsterworth by october 1659. his mother, widowed for the second time, attempted to make him a farmer, an occupation he hated. henry stokes, master at the king's school, persuaded his mother to send him back to school. motivated partly by a desire for revenge against a schoolyard bully, he became the top-ranked student, distinguishing himself mainly by building sundials and models of windmills.

in june 1661, he was admitted to trinity college, cambridge, on the recommendation of his uncle rev william ayscough, who had studied there. he started as a subsizarâpaying his way by performing valet's dutiesâuntil he was awarded a scholarship in 1664, guaranteeing him four more years until he could get his ma. at that time, the college's teachings were based on those of aristotle, whom newton supplemented with modern philosophers such as descartes, and astronomers such as galileo and thomas street, through whom he learned of kepler's work. he set down in his notebook a series of """"quaestiones"""" about mechanical philosophy as he found it. in 1665, he discovered the generalised binomial theorem and began to develop a mathematical theory that later became calculus. soon after newton had obtained his ba degree in august 1665, the university temporarily closed as a precaution against the great plague. although he had been undistinguished as a cambridge student, newton's private studies at his home in woolsthorpe over the subsequent two years saw the development of his theories on calculus, optics, and the law of gravitation.

in april 1667, he returned to cambridge and in october was elected as a fellow of trinity. fellows were required to become ordained priests, although this was not enforced in the restoration years and an assertion of conformity to the church of england was sufficient. however, by 1675 the issue could not be avoided and by then his unconventional views stood in the way. nevertheless, newton managed to avoid it by means of a special permission from charles ii.

his studies had impressed the lucasian professor isaac barrow, who was more anxious to develop his own religious and administrative potential (he became master of trinity two years later); in 1669 newton succeeded him, only one year after receiving his ma. he was elected a fellow of the royal society (frs) in 1672.

newton's work has been said ""to distinctly advance every branch of mathematics then studied."" his work on the subject usually referred to as fluxions or calculus, seen in a manuscript of october 1666, is now published among newton's mathematical papers. the author of the manuscript ""de analysi per aequationes numero terminorum infinitas"", sent by isaac barrow to john collins in june 1669, was identified by barrow in a letter sent to collins in august of that year as ""[...]â of an extraordinary genius and proficiency in these things.""

newton later became involved in a dispute with leibniz over priority in the development of calculus (the leibnizânewton calculus controversy). most modern historians believe that newton and leibniz developed calculus independently, although with very different mathematical notations. occasionally it has been suggested that newton published almost nothing about it until 1693, and did not give a full account until 1704, while leibniz began publishing a full account of his methods in 1684. leibniz's notation and ""differential method"", nowadays recognised as much more convenient notations, were adopted by continental european mathematicians, and after 1820 or so, also by british mathematicians.

such a suggestion fails to account for the calculus in book 1 of newton's ""principia"" itself and in its forerunner manuscripts, such as ""de motu corporum in gyrum"" of 1684; this content has been pointed out by critics of both newton's time and modern times.

his work extensively uses calculus in geometric form based on limiting values of the ratios of vanishingly small quantities: in the ""principia"" itself, newton gave demonstration of this under the name of ""the method of first and last ratios"" and explained why he put his expositions in this form, remarking also that ""hereby the same thing is performed as by the method of indivisibles.""

because of this, the ""principia"" has been called ""a book dense with the theory and application of the infinitesimal calculus"" in modern times and in newton's time ""nearly all of it is of this calculus."" his use of methods involving ""one or more orders of the infinitesimally small"" is present in his ""de motu corporum in gyrum"" of 1684 and in his papers on motion ""during the two decades preceding 1684"".

newton had been reluctant to publish his calculus because he feared controversy and criticism. he was close to the swiss mathematician nicolas fatio de duillier. in 1691, duillier started to write a new version of newton's ""principia"", and corresponded with leibniz. in 1693, the relationship between duillier and newton deteriorated and the book was never completed.

starting in 1699, other members of the royal society accused leibniz of plagiarism. the dispute then broke out in full force in 1711 when the royal society proclaimed in a study that it was newton who was the true discoverer and labelled leibniz a fraud; it was later found that newton wrote the study's concluding remarks on leibniz. thus began the bitter controversy which marred the lives of both newton and leibniz until the latter's death in 1716.

newton is generally credited with the generalised binomial theorem, valid for any exponent. he discovered newton's identities, newton's method, classified cubic plane curves (polynomials of degree three in two variables), made substantial contributions to the theory of finite differences, and was the first to use fractional indices and to employ coordinate geometry to derive solutions to diophantine equations. he approximated partial sums of the harmonic series by logarithms (a precursor to euler's summation formula) and was the first to use power series with confidence and to revert power series. newton's work on infinite series was inspired by simon stevin's decimals.

when newton received his ma and became a fellow of the ""college of the holy and undivided trinity"" in 1667, he made the commitment that ""i will either set theology as the object of my studies and will take holy orders when the time prescribed by these statutes [7â years] arrives, or i will resign from the college."" up until this point he had not thought much about religion and had twice signed his agreement to the thirty-nine articles, the basis of church of england doctrine.

he was appointed lucasian professor of mathematics in 1669, on barrow's recommendation. during that time, any fellow of a college at cambridge or oxford was required to take holy orders and become an ordained anglican priest. however, the terms of the lucasian professorship required that the holder be active in the church â presumably so as to have more time for science. newton argued that this should exempt him from the ordination requirement, and charles ii, whose permission was needed, accepted this argument. thus a conflict between newton's religious views and anglican orthodoxy was averted.

in 1666, newton observed that the spectrum of colours exiting a prism in the position of minimum deviation is oblong, even when the light ray entering the prism is circular, which is to say, the prism refracts different colours by different angles. this led him to conclude that colour is a property intrinsic to lightâa point which had been debated in prior years.

from 1670 to 1672, newton lectured on optics. during this period he investigated the refraction of light, demonstrating that the multicoloured spectrum produced by a prism could be recomposed into white light by a lens and a second prism. modern scholarship has revealed that newton's analysis and resynthesis of white light owes a debt to corpuscular alchemy.

he showed that coloured light does not change its properties by separating out a coloured beam and shining it on various objects, and that regardless of whether reflected, scattered, or transmitted, the light remains the same colour. thus, he observed that colour is the result of objects interacting with already-coloured light rather than objects generating the colour themselves. this is known as newton's theory of colour.

from this work, he concluded that the lens of any refracting telescope would suffer from the dispersion of light into colours (chromatic aberration). as a proof of the concept, he constructed a telescope using reflective mirrors instead of lenses as the objective to bypass that problem. building the design, the first known functional reflecting telescope, today known as a newtonian telescope, involved solving the problem of a suitable mirror material and shaping technique. newton ground his own mirrors out of a custom composition of highly reflective speculum metal, using newton's rings to judge the quality of the optics for his telescopes. in late 1668, he was able to produce this first reflecting telescope. it was about eight inches long and it gave a clearer and larger image. in 1671, the royal society asked for a demonstration of his reflecting telescope. their interest encouraged him to publish his notes, ""of colours"", which he later expanded into the work ""opticks"". when robert hooke criticised some of newton's ideas, newton was so offended that he withdrew from public debate. newton and hooke had brief exchanges in 1679â80, when hooke, appointed to manage the royal society's correspondence, opened up a correspondence intended to elicit contributions from newton to royal society transactions, which had the effect of stimulating newton to work out a proof that the elliptical form of planetary orbits would result from a centripetal force inversely proportional to the square of the radius vector. but the two men remained generally on poor terms until hooke's death.

newton argued that light is composed of particles or corpuscles, which were refracted by accelerating into a denser medium. he verged on soundlike waves to explain the repeated pattern of reflection and transmission by thin films (opticks bk.ii, props. 12), but still retained his theory of 'fits' that disposed corpuscles to be reflected or transmitted (props.13). however, later physicists favoured a purely wavelike explanation of light to account for the interference patterns and the general phenomenon of diffraction. today's quantum mechanics, photons, and the idea of waveâparticle duality bear only a minor resemblance to newton's understanding of light.

in his ""hypothesis of light"" of 1675, newton posited the existence of the ether to transmit forces between particles. the contact with the cambridge platonist philosopher henry more revived his interest in alchemy. he replaced the ether with occult forces based on hermetic ideas of attraction and repulsion between particles. john maynard keynes, who acquired many of newton's writings on alchemy, stated that ""newton was not the first of the age of reason: he was the last of the magicians."" newton's interest in alchemy cannot be isolated from his contributions to science. this was at a time when there was no clear distinction between alchemy and science. had he not relied on the occult idea of action at a distance, across a vacuum, he might not have developed his theory of gravity.

in 1704, newton published ""opticks"", in which he expounded his corpuscular theory of light. he considered light to be made up of extremely subtle corpuscles, that ordinary matter was made of grosser corpuscles and speculated that through a kind of alchemical transmutation ""are not gross bodies and light convertible into one another,â ... and may not bodies receive much of their activity from the particles of light which enter their composition?"" newton also constructed a primitive form of a frictional electrostatic generator, using a glass globe.

in his book ""opticks"", newton was the first to show a diagram using a prism as a beam expander, and also the use of multiple-prism arrays. some 278 years after newton's discussion, multiple-prism beam expanders became central to the development of narrow-linewidth tunable lasers. also, the use of these prismatic beam expanders led to the multiple-prism dispersion theory.

subsequent to newton, much has been amended. young and fresnel combined newton's particle theory with huygens' wave theory to show that colour is the visible manifestation of light's wavelength. science also slowly came to realise the difference between perception of colour and mathematisable optics. the german poet and scientist, goethe, could not shake the newtonian foundation but ""one hole goethe did find in newton's armour,â ... newton had committed himself to the doctrine that refraction without colour was impossible. he therefore thought that the object-glasses of telescopes must for ever remain imperfect, achromatism and refraction being incompatible. this inference was proved by dollond to be wrong.""

in 1679, newton returned to his work on celestial mechanics by considering gravitation and its effect on the orbits of planets with reference to kepler's laws of planetary motion. this followed stimulation by a brief exchange of letters in 1679â80 with hooke, who had been appointed to manage the royal society's correspondence, and who opened a correspondence intended to elicit contributions from newton to royal society transactions. newton's reawakening interest in astronomical matters received further stimulus by the appearance of a comet in the winter of 1680â1681, on which he corresponded with john flamsteed. after the exchanges with hooke, newton worked out proof that the elliptical form of planetary orbits would result from a centripetal force inversely proportional to the square of the radius vector. newton communicated his results to edmond halley and to the royal society in ""de motu corporum in gyrum"", a tract written on about nine sheets which was copied into the royal society's register book in december 1684. this tract contained the nucleus that newton developed and expanded to form the ""principia"".

the ""principia"" was published on 5 july 1687 with encouragement and financial help from edmond halley. in this work, newton stated the three universal laws of motion. together, these laws describe the relationship between any object, the forces acting upon it and the resulting motion, laying the foundation for classical mechanics. they contributed to many advances during the industrial revolution which soon followed and were not improved upon for more than 200 years. many of these advancements continue to be the underpinnings of non-relativistic technologies in the modern world. he used the latin word ""gravitas"" (weight) for the effect that would become known as gravity, and defined the law of universal gravitation.

in the same work, newton presented a calculus-like method of geometrical analysis using 'first and last ratios', gave the first analytical determination (based on boyle's law) of the speed of sound in air, inferred the oblateness of earth's spheroidal figure, accounted for the precession of the equinoxes as a result of the moon's gravitational attraction on the earth's oblateness, initiated the gravitational study of the irregularities in the motion of the moon, provided a theory for the determination of the orbits of comets, and much more.

newton made clear his heliocentric view of the solar systemâdeveloped in a somewhat modern way, because already in the mid-1680s he recognised the ""deviation of the sun"" from the centre of gravity of the solar system. for newton, it was not precisely the centre of the sun or any other body that could be considered at rest, but rather ""the common centre of gravity of the earth, the sun and all the planets is to be esteem'd the centre of the world"", and this centre of gravity ""either is at rest or moves uniformly forward in a right line"" (newton adopted the ""at rest"" alternative in view of common consent that the centre, wherever it was, was at rest).

newton's postulate of an invisible force able to act over vast distances led to him being criticised for introducing ""occult agencies"" into science. later, in the second edition of the ""principia"" (1713), newton firmly rejected such criticisms in a concluding general scholium, writing that it was enough that the phenomena implied a gravitational attraction, as they did; but they did not so far indicate its cause, and it was both unnecessary and improper to frame hypotheses of things that were not implied by the phenomena. (here newton used what became his famous expression """"hypotheses non-fingo"""").

with the ""principia"", newton became internationally recognised. he acquired a circle of admirers, including the swiss-born mathematician nicolas fatio de duillier.

newton found 72 of the 78 ""species"" of cubic curves and categorised them into four types. in 1717, and probably with newton's help, james stirling proved that every cubic was one of these four types. newton also claimed that the four types could be obtained by plane projection from one of them, and this was proved in 1731, four years after his death.

in the 1690s, newton wrote a number of religious tracts dealing with the literal and symbolic interpretation of the bible. a manuscript newton sent to john locke in which he disputed the fidelity of âthe johannine commaâand its fidelity to the original manuscripts of the new testament, remained unpublished until 1785.

newton was also a member of the parliament of england for cambridge university in 1689 and 1701, but according to some accounts his only comments were to complain about a cold draught in the chamber and request that the window be closed. he was, however, noted by cambridge diarist abraham de la pryme to have rebuked students who were frightening locals by claiming that a house was haunted.

newton moved to london to take up the post of warden of the royal mint in 1696, a position that he had obtained through the patronage of charles montagu, 1st earl of halifax, then chancellor of the exchequer. he took charge of england's great recoining, trodden on the toes of lord lucas, governor of the tower, and secured the job of deputy comptroller of the temporary chester branch for edmond halley. newton became perhaps the best-known master of the mint upon the death of thomas neale in 1699, a position newton held for the last 30â years of his life. these appointments were intended as sinecures, but newton took them seriously. he retired from his cambridge duties in 1701, and exercised his authority to reform the currency and punish clippers and counterfeiters.

as warden, and afterwards as master, of the royal mint, newton estimated that 20â percent of the coins taken in during the great recoinage of 1696 were counterfeit. counterfeiting was high treason, punishable by the felon being hanged, drawn and quartered. despite this, convicting even the most flagrant criminals could be extremely difficult, however, newton proved equal to the task.

disguised as a habituã© of bars and taverns, he gathered much of that evidence himself. for all the barriers placed to prosecution, and separating the branches of government, english law still had ancient and formidable customs of authority. newton had himself made a justice of the peace in all the home counties. a draft letter regarding the matter is included in newton's personal first edition of ""philosophiã¦ naturalis principia mathematica"", which he must have been amending at the time. then he conducted more than 100â cross-examinations of witnesses, informers, and suspects between june 1698 and christmas 1699. newton successfully prosecuted 28â coiners.

newton was made president of the royal society in 1703 and an associate of the french acadã©mie des sciences. in his position at the royal society, newton made an enemy of john flamsteed, the astronomer royal, by prematurely publishing flamsteed's ""historia coelestis britannica"", which newton had used in his studies.

in april 1705, queen anne knighted newton during a royal visit to trinity college, cambridge. the knighthood is likely to have been motivated by political considerations connected with the parliamentary election in may 1705, rather than any recognition of newton's scientific work or services as master of the mint. newton was the second scientist to be knighted, after sir francis bacon.

as a result of a report written by newton on 21 september 1717 to the lords commissioners of his majesty's treasury, the bimetallic relationship between gold coins and silver coins was changed by royal proclamation on 22 december 1717, forbidding the exchange of gold guineas for more than 21â silver shillings. this inadvertently resulted in a silver shortage as silver coins were used to pay for imports, while exports were paid for in gold, effectively moving britain from the silver standard to its first gold standard. it is a matter of debate as to whether he intended to do this or not. it has been argued that newton conceived of his work at the mint as a continuation of his alchemical work.

newton was one of many people who lost heavily when the south sea company collapsed circa 1720. their most significant trade was slaves, and according to his niece, he lost around â£20,000.

toward the end of his life, newton took up residence at cranbury park, near winchester with his niece and her husband, until his death in 1727. his half-niece, catherine barton conduitt, served as his hostess in social affairs at his house on jermyn street in london; he was her ""very loving uncle"", according to his letter to her when she was recovering from smallpox.

newton died in his sleep in london on 20 march 1727 (os 20 march 1726; ns 31 march 1727). his body was buried in westminster abbey. voltaire may have been present at his funeral. a bachelor, he had divested much of his estate to relatives during his last years, and died intestate. his papers went to john conduitt and catherine barton. after his death, newton's hair was examined and found to contain mercury, probably resulting from his alchemical pursuits. mercury poisoning could explain newton's eccentricity in late life.

although it was claimed that he was once engaged, newton never married. the french writer and philosopher voltaire, who was in london at the time of newton's funeral, said that he ""was never sensible to any passion, was not subject to the common frailties of mankind, nor had any commerce with womenâa circumstance which was assured me by the physician and surgeon who attended him in his last moments"". the widespread belief that he died a virgin has been commented on by writers such as mathematician charles hutton, economist john maynard keynes, and physicist carl sagan.

newton had a close friendship with the swiss mathematician nicolas fatio de duillier, whom he met in london around 1689âsome of their correspondence has survived. their relationship came to an abrupt and unexplained end in 1693, and at the same time newton suffered a nervous breakdown which included sending wild accusatory letters to his friends samuel pepys and john lockeâhis note to the latter included the charge that locke ""endeavoured to embroil me with woemen"".

the mathematician joseph-louis lagrange said that newton was the greatest genius who ever lived, and once added that newton was also ""the most fortunate, for we cannot find more than once a system of the world to establish."" english poet alexander pope wrote the famous epitaph:

nature and nature's laws lay hid in night;<br>
god said ""let newton be"" and all was light.

newton was relatively modest about his achievements, writing in a letter to robert hooke in february 1676:
if i have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.

two writers think that the above quotation, written at a time when newton and hooke were in dispute over optical discoveries, was an oblique attack on hooke (said to have been short and hunchbacked), rather thanâor in addition toâa statement of modesty. on the other hand, the widely known proverb about standing on the shoulders of giants, published among others by seventeenth-century poet george herbert (a former orator of the university of cambridge and fellow of trinity college) in his ""jacula prudentum"" (1651), had as its main point that ""a dwarf on a giant's shoulders sees farther of the two"", and so its effect as an analogy would place newton himself rather than hooke as the 'dwarf'.

in a later memoir, newton wrote:
i do not know what i may appear to the world, but to myself i seem to have been only like a boy playing on the sea-shore, and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me.

in 1816, a tooth said to have belonged to newton was sold for â£730 ($3,633) in london to an aristocrat who had it set in a ring. the ""guinness world records 2002"" classified it as the most valuable tooth, which would value approximately â£25,000 ($35,700) in late 2001. who bought it and who currently has it has not been disclosed.

albert einstein kept a picture of newton on his study wall alongside ones of michael faraday and james clerk maxwell. newton remains influential to today's scientists, as demonstrated by a 2005 survey of members of britain's royal society (formerly headed by newton) asking who had the greater effect on the history of science, newton or einstein. royal society scientists deemed newton to have made the greater overall contribution. in 1999, an opinion poll of 100 of today's leading physicists voted einstein the ""greatest physicist ever;"" with newton the runner-up, while a parallel survey of rank-and-file physicists by the site physicsweb gave the top spot to newton.

newton's monument (1731) can be seen in westminster abbey, at the north of the entrance to the choir against the choir screen, near his tomb. it was executed by the sculptor michael rysbrack (1694â1770) in white and grey marble with design by the architect william kent. the monument features a figure of newton reclining on top of a sarcophagus, his right elbow resting on several of his great books and his left hand pointing to a scroll with a mathematical design. above him is a pyramid and a celestial globe showing the signs of the zodiac and the path of the comet of 1680. a relief panel depicts putti using instruments such as a telescope and prism. the latin inscription on the base translates as:here is buried isaac newton, knight, who by a strength of mind almost divine, and mathematical principles peculiarly his own, explored the course and figures of the planets, the paths of comets, the tides of the sea, the dissimilarities in rays of light, and, what no other scholar has previously imagined, the properties of the colours thus produced. diligent, sagacious and faithful, in his expositions of nature, antiquity and the holy scriptures, he vindicated by his philosophy the majesty of god mighty and good, and expressed the simplicity of the gospel in his manners. mortals rejoice that there has existed such and so great an ornament of the human race! he was born on 25 december 1642, and died on 20 march 1726/7.âtranslation from g.l. smyth, ""the monuments and genii of st. paul's cathedral, and of westminster abbey"" (1826), ii, 703â704.

from 1978 until 1988, an image of newton designed by harry ecclestone appeared on series d â£1 banknotes issued by the bank of england (the last â£1 notes to be issued by the bank of england). newton was shown on the reverse of the notes holding a book and accompanied by a telescope, a prism and a map of the solar system.

a statue of isaac newton, looking at an apple at his feet, can be seen at the oxford university museum of natural history. a large bronze statue, ""newton, after william blake"", by eduardo paolozzi, dated 1995 and inspired by blake's etching, dominates the piazza of the british library in london.

although born into an anglican family, by his thirties newton held a christian faith that, had it been made public, would not have been considered orthodox by mainstream christianity; in recent times he has been described as a heretic.

by 1672, he had started to record his theological researches in notebooks which he showed to no one and which have only recently been examined. they demonstrate an extensive knowledge of early church writings and show that in the conflict between athanasius and arius which defined the creed, he took the side of arius, the loser, who rejected the conventional view of the trinity. newton ""recognized christ as a divine mediator between god and man, who was subordinate to the father who created him."" he was especially interested in prophecy, but for him, ""the great apostasy was trinitarianism.""

newton tried unsuccessfully to obtain one of the two fellowships that exempted the holder from the ordination requirement. at the last moment in 1675 he received a dispensation from the government that excused him and all future holders of the lucasian chair.

in newton's eyes, worshipping christ as god was idolatry, to him the fundamental sin. historian stephen d. snobelen says, ""isaac newton was a heretic. butâ ... he never made a public declaration of his private faithâwhich the orthodox would have deemed extremely radical. he hid his faith so well that scholars are still unravelling his personal beliefs."" snobelen concludes that newton was at least a socinian sympathiser (he owned and had thoroughly read at least eight socinian books), possibly an arian and almost certainly an anti-trinitarian.

in a minority position, t.c. pfizenmaier offers a more nuanced view, arguing that newton held closer to the semi-arian view of the trinity that jesus christ was of a ""similar substance"" (homoiousios) from the father rather than the orthodox view that jesus christ is of the ""same substance"" of the father (homoousios) as endorsed by modern eastern orthodox, roman catholics and protestants. however, this type of view 'has lost support of late with the availability of newton's theological papers', and now most scholars identify newton as an antitrinitarian monotheist.

although the laws of motion and universal gravitation became newton's best-known discoveries, he warned against using them to view the universe as a mere machine, as if akin to a great clock. he said, ""gravity explains the motions of the planets, but it cannot explain who set the planets in motion. god governs all things and knows all that is or can be done.""

along with his scientific fame, newton's studies of the bible and of the early church fathers were also noteworthy. newton wrote works on textual criticism, most notably ""an historical account of two notable corruptions of scripture"" and ""observations upon the prophecies of daniel, and the apocalypse of st. john"". he placed the crucifixion of jesus christ at 3 april, ad 33, which agrees with one traditionally accepted date.

he believed in a rationally immanent world, but he rejected the hylozoism implicit in leibniz and baruch spinoza. the ordered and dynamically informed universe could be understood, and must be understood, by an active reason. in his correspondence, newton claimed that in writing the ""principia"" ""i had an eye upon such principles as might work with considering men for the belief of a deity"". he saw evidence of design in the system of the world: ""such a wonderful uniformity in the planetary system must be allowed the effect of choice"". but newton insisted that divine intervention would eventually be required to reform the system, due to the slow growth of instabilities. for this, leibniz lampooned him: ""god almighty wants to wind up his watch from time to time: otherwise it would cease to move. he had not, it seems, sufficient foresight to make it a perpetual motion.""

newton's position was vigorously defended by his follower samuel clarke in a famous correspondence. a century later, pierre-simon laplace's work ""celestial mechanics"" had a natural explanation for why the planet orbits do not require periodic divine intervention.

scholars long debated whether newton disputed the doctrine of the trinity. his first biographer, sir david brewster, who compiled his manuscripts, interpreted newton as questioning the veracity of some passages used to support the trinity, but never denying the doctrine of the trinity as such. in the twentieth century, encrypted manuscripts written by newton and bought by john maynard keynes (among others) were deciphered and it became known that newton did indeed reject trinitarianism.

newton and robert boyle's approach to the mechanical philosophy was promoted by rationalist pamphleteers as a viable alternative to the pantheists and enthusiasts, and was accepted hesitantly by orthodox preachers as well as dissident preachers like the latitudinarians. the clarity and simplicity of science was seen as a way to combat the emotional and metaphysical superlatives of both superstitious enthusiasm and the threat of atheism, and at the same time, the second wave of english deists used newton's discoveries to demonstrate the possibility of a ""natural religion"".

the attacks made against pre-enlightenment ""magical thinking"", and the mystical elements of christianity, were given their foundation with boyle's mechanical conception of the universe. newton gave boyle's ideas their completion through mathematical proofs and, perhaps more importantly, was very successful in popularising them.

in a manuscript he wrote in 1704 (never intended to be published) he mentions the date of 2060, but it is not given as a date for the end of days. it has been falsely reported as a prediction. the passage is clear, when the date is read in context. he was against date setting for the end of days, concerned that this would put christianity into disrepute.

""so then the time times & half a time are 42 months or 1260 days or three years & an half, recconing twelve months to a year & 30 days to a month as was done in the calender of the primitive year. and the days of short lived beasts being put for the years of [long-]lived kingdoms the period of 1260 days, if dated from the complete conquest of the three kings a.c. 800, will end 2060. it may end later, but i see no reason for its ending sooner.""

""this i mention not to assert when the time of the end shall be, but to put a stop to the rash conjectures of fanciful men who are frequently predicting the time of the end, and by doing so bring the sacred prophesies into discredit as often as their predictions fail. christ comes as a thief in the night, and it is not for us to know the times and seasons which god hath put into his own breast.""

in the character of morton opperly in ""poor superman"" (1951), speculative fiction author fritz leiber says of newton, ""everyone knows newton as the great scientist. few remember that he spent half his life muddling with alchemy, looking for the philosopher's stone. that was the pebble by the seashore he really wanted to find.""

of an estimated ten million words of writing in newton's papers, about one million deal with alchemy. many of newton's writings on alchemy are copies of other manuscripts, with his own annotations. alchemical texts mix artisanal knowledge with philosophical speculation, often hidden behind layers of wordplay, allegory, and imagery to protect craft secrets. some of the content contained in newton's papers could have been considered heretical by the church.

in 1888, after spending sixteen years cataloging newton's papers, cambridge university kept a small number and returned the rest to the earl of portsmouth. in 1936, a descendant offered the papers for sale at sotheby's. the collection was broken up and sold for a total of about â£9,000. john maynard keynes was one of about three dozen bidders who obtained part of the collection at auction. keynes went on to reassemble an estimated half of newton's collection of papers on alchemy before donating his collection to cambridge university in 1946.

all of newton's known writings on alchemy are currently being put online in a project undertaken by indiana university: ""the chymistry of isaac newton"" and summarised in a book.

charles coulston gillispie disputes that newton ever practiced alchemy, saying that ""his chemistry was in the spirit of boyle's corpuscular philosphy.""

enlightenment philosophers chose a short history of scientific predecessorsâgalileo, boyle, and newton principallyâas the guides and guarantors of their applications of the singular concept of nature and natural law to every physical and social field of the day. in this respect, the lessons of history and the social structures built upon it could be discarded.

it was newton's conception of the universe based upon natural and rationally understandable laws that became one of the seeds for enlightenment ideology. locke and voltaire applied concepts of natural law to political systems advocating intrinsic rights; the physiocrats and adam smith applied natural conceptions of psychology and self-interest to economic systems; and sociologists criticised the current social order for trying to fit history into natural models of progress. monboddo and samuel clarke resisted elements of newton's work, but eventually rationalised it to conform with their strong religious views of nature.

newton himself often told the story that he was inspired to formulate his theory of gravitation by watching the fall of an apple from a tree. the story is believed to have passed into popular knowledge after being related by catherine barton, newton's niece, to voltaire. voltaire then wrote in his ""essay on epic poetry"" (1727), ""sir isaac newton walking in his gardens, had the first thought of his system of gravitation, upon seeing an apple falling from a tree.""

although it has been said that the apple story is a myth and that he did not arrive at his theory of gravity in any single moment, acquaintances of newton (such as william stukeley, whose manuscript account of 1752 has been made available by the royal society) do in fact confirm the incident, though not the apocryphal version that the apple actually hit newton's head. stukeley recorded in his ""memoirs of sir isaac newton's life"" a conversation with newton in kensington on 15 april 1726:

john conduitt, newton's assistant at the royal mint and husband of newton's niece, also described the event when he wrote about newton's life:

it is known from his notebooks that newton was grappling in the late 1660s with the idea that terrestrial gravity extends, in an inverse-square proportion, to the moon; however it took him two decades to develop the full-fledged theory. the question was not whether gravity existed, but whether it extended so far from earth that it could also be the force holding the moon to its orbit. newton showed that if the force decreased as the inverse square of the distance, one could indeed calculate the moon's orbital period, and get good agreement. he guessed the same force was responsible for other orbital motions, and hence named it ""universal gravitation"".

various trees are claimed to be ""the"" apple tree which newton describes. the king's school, grantham claims that the tree was purchased by the school, uprooted and transported to the headmaster's garden some years later. the staff of the (now) national trust-owned woolsthorpe manor dispute this, and claim that a tree present in their gardens is the one described by newton. a descendant of the original tree can be seen growing outside the main gate of trinity college, cambridge, below the room newton lived in when he studied there. the national fruit collection at brogdale in kent can supply grafts from their tree, which appears identical to flower of kent, a coarse-fleshed cooking variety.

barack obama,"
barack hussein obama ii (; born august 4, 1961) is an american attorney and politician who served as the 44th president of the united states from 2009 to 2017. a member of the democratic party, he was the first african american to be elected to the presidency. he previously served as a u.s. senator from illinois from 2005 to 2008 and an illinois state senator from 1997 to 2004.

obama was born in honolulu, hawaii. after graduating from columbia university in 1983, he worked as a community organizer in chicago. in 1988, he enrolled in harvard law school, where he was the first black president of the ""harvard law review"". after graduating, he became a civil rights attorney and an academic, teaching constitutional law at the university of chicago law school from 1992 to 2004. he represented the 13th district for three terms in the illinois senate from 1997 until 2004, when he ran for the u.s. senate. he received national attention in 2004 with his march primary win, his well-received july democratic national convention keynote address, and his landslide november election to the senate. in 2008, he was nominated for president a year after his campaign began, after a close primary campaign against hillary clinton. he was elected over republican john mccain and was inaugurated on january 20, 2009. nine months later, he was named the 2009 nobel peace prize laureate.

regarded as a centrist new democrat, obama signed many landmark bills into law during his first two years in office. the main reforms that were passed include the patient protection and affordable care act (commonly referred to as the ""affordable care act"" or ""obamacare""), the doddâfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act, and the don't ask, don't tell repeal act of 2010. the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009 and tax relief, unemployment insurance reauthorization, and job creation act of 2010 served as economic stimulus amidst the great recession. after a lengthy debate over the national debt limit, he signed the budget control and the american taxpayer relief acts. in foreign policy, he increased u.s. troop levels in afghanistan, reduced nuclear weapons with the united statesârussia new start treaty, and ended military involvement in the iraq war. he ordered military involvement in libya, contributing to the overthrow of muammar gaddafi. he also ordered the military operations that resulted in the deaths of osama bin laden and suspected yemeni al-qaeda operative anwar al-awlaki.

after winning re-election by defeating republican opponent mitt romney, obama was sworn in for a second term in 2013. during this term, he promoted inclusiveness for lgbt americans. his administration filed briefs that urged the supreme court to strike down same-sex marriage bans as unconstitutional (""united states v. windsor"" and ""obergefell v. hodges""); same-sex marriage was fully legalized in 2015 after the court ruled that a same-sex marriage ban was unconstitutional in ""obergefell"". he advocated for gun control in response to the sandy hook elementary school shooting, indicating support for a ban on assault weapons, and issued wide-ranging executive actions concerning global warming and immigration. in foreign policy, he ordered military intervention in iraq in response to gains made by isil after the 2011 withdrawal from iraq, continued the process of ending u.s. combat operations in afghanistan in 2016, promoted discussions that led to the 2015 paris agreement on global climate change, initiated sanctions against russia following the invasion in ukraine and again after russian interference in the 2016 united states elections, brokered a nuclear deal with iran, and normalized u.s. relations with cuba. obama nominated three justices to the supreme court: sonia sotomayor and elena kagan were confirmed as justices, while merrick garland faced unprecedented partisan obstruction and was ultimately not confirmed. during his term in office, america's soft power and reputation abroad significantly improved.

obama's presidency has generally been regarded favorably, and evaluations of his presidency among historians, political scientists, and the general public place him among the upper tier of american presidents. obama left office and retired in january 2017 and currently resides in washington, d.c. a december 2018 gallup poll found obama to be the most admired man in america for an unprecedented 11th consecutive year, although dwight d. eisenhower was selected most admired in twelve non-consecutive years.

obama was born on august 4, 1961, at kapiolani medical center for women and children in honolulu, hawaii. he is the only president born outside the contiguous 48 states. he was born to a white mother and a black father. his mother, ann dunham (1942â1995), was born in wichita, kansas; she was mostly of english descent, with some german, irish (3.13%), scottish, swiss, and welsh ancestry. his father, barack obama sr. (1936â1982), was a luo kenyan from nyang'oma kogelo. obama's parents met in 1960 in a russian language class at the university of hawaii at manoa, where his father was a foreign student on a scholarship. the couple married in wailuku, hawaii, on february 2, 1961, six months before obama was born.

in late august 1961, a few weeks after he was born, barack and his mother moved to the university of washington in seattle, where they lived for a year. during that time, the elder obama completed his undergraduate degree in economics in hawaii, graduating in june 1962. he left to attend graduate school on a scholarship at harvard university, where he earned an m.a. in economics. obama's parents divorced in march 1964. obama sr. returned to kenya in 1964, where he married for a third time and worked for the kenyan government as the senior economic analyst in the ministry of finance. he visited his son in hawaii only once, at christmas 1971, before he was killed in an automobile accident in 1982, when obama was 21 years old. recalling his early childhood, obama said, ""that my father looked nothing like the people around me â that he was black as pitch, my mother white as milk â barely registered in my mind."" he described his struggles as a young adult to reconcile social perceptions of his multiracial heritage.

in 1963, dunham met lolo soetoro at the university of hawaii; he was an indonesian eastâwest center graduate student in geography. the couple married on molokai on march 15, 1965. after two one-year extensions of his j-1 visa, lolo returned to indonesia in 1966. his wife and stepson followed sixteen months later in 1967. the family initially lived in the menteng dalam neighborhood in the tebet sub district of south jakarta. from 1970, they lived in a wealthier neighborhood in the menteng sub district of central jakarta.

obama started in st. francis pre-education from age three to five. from age six to ten, he then attended local indonesian-language schools: ""sekolah dasar katolik santo fransiskus asisi"" (st. francis of assisi catholic elementary school) for two years and ""sekolah dasar negeri menteng 01"" (state elementary school menteng 01/besuki school) for one and a half years, supplemented by english-language calvert school homeschooling by his mother. as a result of those four years in jakarta, he was able to speak indonesian fluently as a child. during his time in indonesia, obama's step-father taught him to be resilient and gave him ""a pretty hardheaded assessment of how the world works"".

in 1971, obama returned to honolulu to live with his maternal grandparents, madelyn and stanley dunham. he attended punahou schoolâa private college preparatory schoolâwith the aid of a scholarship from fifth grade until he graduated from high school in 1979. in his youth, obama went by the nickname ""barry"". obama lived with his mother and half-sister, maya soetoro, in hawaii for three years from 1972 to 1975 while his mother was a graduate student in anthropology at the university of hawaii. obama chose to stay in hawaii with his grandparents for high school at punahou when his mother and half-sister returned to indonesia in 1975 so his mother could begin anthropology field work. his mother spent most of the next two decades in indonesia, divorcing lolo in 1980 and earning a phd degree in 1992, before dying in 1995 in hawaii following unsuccessful treatment for ovarian and uterine cancer.

obama later reflected on his years in honolulu and wrote: ""the opportunity that hawaii offered â to experience a variety of cultures in a climate of mutual respect â became an integral part of my world view, and a basis for the values that i hold most dear."" obama has also written and talked about using alcohol, marijuana, and cocaine during his teenage years to ""push questions of who i was out of my mind"". obama was also a member of the ""choom gang"", a self-named group of friends who spent time together and occasionally smoked marijuana.

after graduating from high school in 1979, obama moved to los angeles to attend occidental college. in february 1981, obama made his first public speech, calling for occidental to participate in the disinvestment from south africa in response to that nation's policy of apartheid. in mid-1981, obama traveled to indonesia to visit his mother and half-sister maya, and visited the families of college friends in pakistan and india for three weeks. later in 1981, he transferred as a junior to columbia university in new york city, where he majored in political science with a specialty in international relations and in english literature and lived off-campus on west 109th street. he graduated with a ba degree in 1983 and worked for about a year at the business international corporation, where he was a financial researcher and writer, then as a project coordinator for the new york public interest research group on the city college of new york campus for three months in 1985.

in a 2006 interview, obama highlighted the diversity of his extended family: ""it's like a little mini-united nations"", he said. ""i've got relatives who look like bernie mac, and i've got relatives who look like margaret thatcher."" obama has a half-sister with whom he was raised (maya soetoro-ng) and seven other half-siblings from his kenyan father's familyâsix of them living. obama's mother was survived by her kansas-born mother, madelyn dunham, until her death on november 2, 2008, two days before his election to the presidency. obama also has roots in ireland; he met with his irish cousins in moneygall in may 2011. in ""dreams from my father"", obama ties his mother's family history to possible native american ancestors and distant relatives of jefferson davis, president of the confederate states of america during the american civil war. he also shares distant ancestors in common with george w. bush and dick cheney, among others.
obama is a supporter of the chicago white sox, and he threw out the first pitch at the 2005 alcs when he was still a senator. in 2009, he threw out the ceremonial first pitch at the all-star game while wearing a white sox jacket. he is also primarily a chicago bears football fan in the nfl, but in his childhood and adolescence was a fan of the pittsburgh steelers, and rooted for them ahead of their victory in super bowl xliii 12 days after he took office as president. in 2011, obama invited the 1985 chicago bears to the white house; the team had not visited the white house after their super bowl win in 1986 due to the space shuttle challenger disaster. he plays basketball, a sport he participated in as a member of his high school's varsity team, and he is left-handed.

obama lived with anthropologist sheila miyoshi jager while he was a community organizer in chicago in the 1980s. he proposed to her twice, but both jager and her parents turned him down. the relationship was not made public until may 2017, several months after his presidency had ended.

in june 1989, obama met michelle robinson when he was employed as a summer associate at the chicago law firm of sidley austin. robinson was assigned for three months as obama's adviser at the firm, and she joined him at several group social functions but declined his initial requests to date. they began dating later that summer, became engaged in 1991, and were married on october 3, 1992. after suffering a miscarriage, michelle underwent in vitro fertilisation to conceive their children. the couple's first daughter, malia ann, was born in 1998, followed by a second daughter, natasha (""sasha""), in 2001. the obama daughters attended the university of chicago laboratory schools. when they moved to washington, d.c., in january 2009, the girls started at the sidwell friends school. the obamas have two portuguese water dogs; the first, a male named bo, was a gift from senator ted kennedy. in 2013, bo was joined by sunny, a female.
in 2005, the family applied the proceeds of a book deal and moved from a hyde park, chicago condominium to a $1.6â million house (equivalent to $â million in ) in neighboring kenwood, chicago. the purchase of an adjacent lotâand sale of part of it to obama by the wife of developer, campaign donor and friend tony rezkoâattracted media attention because of rezko's subsequent indictment and conviction on political corruption charges that were unrelated to obama.

in december 2007, ""money magazine"" estimated obama's net worth at $1.3â million (equivalent to $â million in ) . their 2009 tax return showed a household income of $5.5â millionâup from about $4.2â million in 2007 and $1.6â million in 2005âmostly from sales of his books. on his 2010 income of $1.7â million, he gave 14% to non-profit organizations, including $131,000 to fisher house foundation, a charity assisting wounded veterans' families, allowing them to reside near where the veteran is receiving medical treatments. per his 2012 financial disclosure, obama may be worth as much as $10â million.

in early 2010, michelle spoke about her husband's smoking habit and said barack had quit smoking.

on his 55th birthday, august 4, 2016, obama penned an essay in ""glamour"", in which he described how his daughters and the presidency have made him a feminist.

obama is a protestant christian whose religious views developed in his adult life. he wrote in ""the audacity of hope"" that he ""was not raised in a religious household"". he described his mother, raised by non-religious parents, as being detached from religion, yet ""in many ways the most spiritually awakened person... i have ever known"". he described his father as a ""confirmed atheist"" by the time his parents met, and his stepfather as ""a man who saw religion as not particularly useful"". obama explained how, through working with black churches as a community organizer while in his twenties, he came to understand ""the power of the african-american religious tradition to spur social change.""
in january 2008, obama told ""christianity today"": ""i am a christian, and i am a devout christian. i believe in the redemptive death and resurrection of jesus christ. i believe that faith gives me a path to be cleansed of sin and have eternal life."" on september 27, 2010, obama released a statement commenting on his religious views saying, ""i'm a christian by choice. my family didn't â frankly, they weren't folks who went to church every week. and my mother was one of the most spiritual people i knew, but she didn't raise me in the church. so i came to my christian faith later in life, and it was because the precepts of jesus christ spoke to me in terms of the kind of life that i would want to lead â being my brothers' and sisters' keeper, treating others as they would treat me.""

obama met trinity united church of christ pastor jeremiah wright in october 1987 and became a member of trinity in 1992. during obama's first presidential campaign in may 2008, he resigned from trinity after some of wright's statements were criticized. since moving to washington, d.c., in 2009, the obama family has attended several protestant churches, including shiloh baptist church and st. john's episcopal church, as well as evergreen chapel at camp david, but the members of the family do not attend church on a regular basis.

two years after graduating from columbia, obama moved from new york to chicago when he was hired as director of the developing communities project, a church-based community organization originally comprising eight catholic parishes in roseland, west pullman, and riverdale on chicago's south side. he worked there as a community organizer from june 1985 to may 1988. he helped set up a job training program, a college preparatory tutoring program, and a tenants' rights organization in altgeld gardens. obama also worked as a consultant and instructor for the gamaliel foundation, a community organizing institute. in mid-1988, he traveled for the first time in europe for three weeks and then for five weeks in kenya, where he met many of his paternal relatives for the first time.
obama entered harvard law school in the fall of 1988, living in nearby somerville, massachusetts. he was selected as an editor of the ""harvard law review"" at the end of his first year, president of the journal in his second year, and research assistant to the constitutional scholar laurence tribe while at harvard for two years. during his summers, he returned to chicago, where he worked as a summer associate at the law firms of sidley austin in 1989 and hopkins & sutter in 1990. after graduating with a jd degree ""magna cum laude"" from harvard in 1991, he returned to chicago. obama's election as the first black president of the ""harvard law review"" gained national media attention and led to a publishing contract and advance for a book about race relations, which evolved into a personal memoir. the manuscript was published in mid-1995 as ""dreams from my father"".

in 1991, obama accepted a two-year position as visiting law and government fellow at the university of chicago law school to work on his first book. he then taught constitutional law at the university of chicago law school for twelve years, first as a lecturer from 1992 to 1996, and then as a senior lecturer from 1996 to 2004.

from april to october 1992, obama directed illinois's project vote, a voter registration campaign with ten staffers and seven hundred volunteer registrars; it achieved its goal of registering 150,000 of 400,000 unregistered african americans in the state, leading ""crain's chicago business"" to name obama to its 1993 list of ""40 under forty"" powers to be.

he joined davis, miner, barnhill & galland, a 13-attorney law firm specializing in civil rights litigation and neighborhood economic development, where he was an associate for three years from 1993 to 1996, then of counsel from 1996 to 2004. in 1994, he was listed as one of the lawyers in ""buycks-roberson v. citibank fed. sav. bank"", 94 c 4094 (n.d. ill.). this class action lawsuit was filed in 1994 with selma buycks-roberson as lead plaintiff and alleged that citibank federal savings bank had engaged in practices forbidden under the equal credit opportunity act and the fair housing act. the case was settled out of court. final judgment was issued on may 13, 1998, with citibank federal savings bank agreeing to pay attorney fees. his law license became inactive in 2007.

from 1994 to 2002, obama served on the boards of directors of the woods fund of chicagoâwhich in 1985 had been the first foundation to fund the developing communities projectâand of the joyce foundation. he served on the board of directors of the chicago annenberg challenge from 1995 to 2002, as founding president and chairman of the board of directors from 1995 to 1999.

obama was elected to the illinois senate in 1996, succeeding democratic state senator alice palmer from illinois's 13th district, which, at that time, spanned chicago south side neighborhoods from hyde parkâkenwood south to south shore and west to chicago lawn. once elected, obama gained bipartisan support for legislation that reformed ethics and health care laws. he sponsored a law that increased tax credits for low-income workers, negotiated welfare reform, and promoted increased subsidies for childcare. in 2001, as co-chairman of the bipartisan joint committee on administrative rules, obama supported republican governor ryan's payday loan regulations and predatory mortgage lending regulations aimed at averting home foreclosures.

he was reelected to the illinois senate in 1998, defeating republican yesse yehudah in the general election, and was re-elected again in 2002. in 2000, he lost a democratic primary race for illinois's 1st congressional district in the united states house of representatives to four-term incumbent bobby rush by a margin of two to one.

in january 2003, obama became chairman of the illinois senate's health and human services committee when democrats, after a decade in the minority, regained a majority. he sponsored and led unanimous, bipartisan passage of legislation to monitor racial profiling by requiring police to record the race of drivers they detained, and legislation making illinois the first state to mandate videotaping of homicide interrogations. during his 2004 general election campaign for the u.s. senate, police representatives credited obama for his active engagement with police organizations in enacting death penalty reforms. obama resigned from the illinois senate in november 2004 following his election to the u.s. senate.

in may 2002, obama commissioned a poll to assess his prospects in a 2004 u.s. senate race. he created a campaign committee, began raising funds, and lined up political media consultant david axelrod by august 2002. obama formally announced his candidacy in january 2003.

obama was an early opponent of the george w. bush administration's 2003 invasion of iraq. on october 2, 2002, the day president bush and congress agreed on the joint resolution authorizing the iraq war, obama addressed the first high-profile chicago anti-iraq war rally, and spoke out against the war. he addressed another anti-war rally in march 2003 and told the crowd ""it's not too late"" to stop the war.

decisions by republican incumbent peter fitzgerald and his democratic predecessor carol moseley braun to not participate in the election resulted in wide-open democratic and republican primary contests involving 15 candidates. in the march 2004 primary election, obama won in an unexpected landslideâwhich overnight made him a rising star within the national democratic party, started speculation about a presidential future, and led to the reissue of his memoir, ""dreams from my father"". in july 2004, obama delivered the keynote address at the 2004 democratic national convention, seen by nine million viewers. his speech was well received and elevated his status within the democratic party.

obama's expected opponent in the general election, republican primary winner jack ryan, withdrew from the race in june 2004. six weeks later, alan keyes accepted the republican nomination to replace ryan. in the november 2004 general election, obama won with 70% of the vote.

obama was sworn in as a senator on january 3, 2005, becoming the only senate member of the congressional black caucus. ""cq weekly"" characterized him as a ""loyal democrat"" based on analysis of all senate votes from 2005 to 2007. obama announced on november 13, 2008, that he would resign his senate seat on november 16, 2008, before the start of the lame-duck session, to focus on his transition period for the presidency.

obama cosponsored the secure america and orderly immigration act. he introduced two initiatives that bore his name: lugarâobama, which expanded the nunnâlugar cooperative threat reduction concept to conventional weapons; and the federal funding accountability and transparency act of 2006, which authorized the establishment of usaspending.gov, a web search engine on federal spending. on june 3, 2008, senator obamaâalong with senators tom carper, tom coburn, and john mccainâintroduced follow-up legislation: strengthening transparency and accountability in federal spending act of 2008.

obama sponsored legislation that would have required nuclear plant owners to notify state and local authorities of radioactive leaks, but the bill failed to pass in the full senate after being heavily modified in committee. regarding tort reform, obama voted for the class action fairness act of 2005 and the fisa amendments act of 2008, which grants immunity from civil liability to telecommunications companies complicit with nsa warrantless wiretapping operations.
in december 2006, president bush signed into law the democratic republic of the congo relief, security, and democracy promotion act, marking the first federal legislation to be enacted with obama as its primary sponsor. in january 2007, obama and senator feingold introduced a corporate jet provision to the honest leadership and open government act, which was signed into law in september 2007. obama also introduced two unsuccessful bills: the deceptive practices and voter intimidation prevention act to criminalize deceptive practices in federal elections, and the iraq war de-escalation act of 2007.

later in 2007, obama sponsored an amendment to the defense authorization act to add safeguards for personality-disorder military discharges. this amendment passed the full senate in the spring of 2008. he sponsored the iran sanctions enabling act supporting divestment of state pension funds from iran's oil and gas industry, which was never enacted but later incorporated in the comprehensive iran sanctions, accountability, and divestment act of 2010; and co-sponsored legislation to reduce risks of nuclear terrorism. obama also sponsored a senate amendment to the state children's health insurance program, providing one year of job protection for family members caring for soldiers with combat-related injuries.

obama held assignments on the senate committees for foreign relations, environment and public works and veterans' affairs through december 2006. in january 2007, he left the environment and public works committee and took additional assignments with health, education, labor and pensions and homeland security and governmental affairs. he also became chairman of the senate's subcommittee on european affairs. as a member of the senate foreign relations committee, obama made official trips to eastern europe, the middle east, central asia and africa. he met with mahmoud abbas before abbas became president of the palestinian national authority, and gave a speech at the university of nairobi in which he condemned corruption within the kenyan government.

on february 10, 2007, obama announced his candidacy for president of the united states in front of the old state capitol building in springfield, illinois. the choice of the announcement site was viewed as symbolic because it was also where abraham lincoln delivered his historic ""house divided"" speech in 1858. obama emphasized issues of rapidly ending the iraq war, increasing energy independence, and reforming the health care system, in a campaign that projected themes of hope and change.

numerous candidates entered the democratic party presidential primaries. the field narrowed to a duel between obama and senator hillary clinton after early contests, with the race remaining close throughout the primary process but with obama gaining a steady lead in pledged delegates due to better long-range planning, superior fundraising, dominant organizing in caucus states, and better exploitation of delegate allocation rules. on june 7, 2008, clinton ended her campaign and endorsed obama.

on august 23, obama announced his selection of delaware senator joe biden as his vice presidential running mate. obama selected biden from a field speculated to include former indiana governor and senator evan bayh and virginia governor tim kaine. at the democratic national convention in denver, colorado, hillary clinton called for her supporters to endorse obama, and she and bill clinton gave convention speeches in his support. obama delivered his acceptance speech, not at the center where the democratic national convention was held, but at invesco field at mile high to a crowd of approximately 84,000 people; the speech was viewed by over 38â million people worldwide.

during both the primary process and the general election, obama's campaign set numerous fundraising records, particularly in the quantity of small donations. on june 19, 2008, obama became the first major-party presidential candidate to turn down public financing in the general election since the system was created in 1976.

john mccain was nominated as the republican candidate, and he selected sarah palin as his running mate. the two candidates engaged in three presidential debates in september and october 2008. on november 4, obama won the presidency with 365 electoral votes to 173 received by mccain. obama won 52.9% of the popular vote to mccain's 45.7%. he became the first african american to be elected president. obama delivered his victory speech before hundreds of thousands of supporters in chicago's grant park.

on april 4, 2011, obama announced his reelection campaign for 2012 in a video titled ""it begins with us"" that he posted on his website and filed election papers with the federal election commission. as the incumbent president he ran virtually unopposed in the democratic party presidential primaries, and on april 3, 2012, obama had secured the 2778 convention delegates needed to win the democratic nomination.

at the democratic national convention in charlotte, north carolina, obama and joe biden were formally nominated by former president bill clinton as the democratic party candidates for president and vice president in the general election. their main opponents were republicans mitt romney, the former governor of massachusetts, and representative paul ryan of wisconsin.

on november 6, 2012, obama won 332 electoral votes, exceeding the 270 required for him to be reelected as president. with 51.1% of the popular vote, obama became the first democratic president since franklin d. roosevelt to win the majority of the popular vote twice. obama addressed supporters and volunteers at chicago's mccormick place after his reelection and said: ""tonight you voted for action, not politics as usual. you elected us to focus on your jobs, not ours. and in the coming weeks and months, i am looking forward to reaching out and working with leaders of both parties.""

the inauguration of barack obama as the 44th president took place on january 20, 2009. in his first few days in office, obama issued executive orders and presidential memoranda directing the u.s. military to develop plans to withdraw troops from iraq. he ordered the closing of the guantanamo bay detention camp, but congress prevented the closure by refusing to appropriate the required funds and preventing moving any guantanamo detainee into the u.s. or to other countries. obama reduced the secrecy given to presidential records. he also revoked president george w. bush's restoration of president ronald reagan's mexico city policy prohibiting federal aid to international family planning organizations that perform or provide counseling about abortion.

the first bill signed into law by obama was the lilly ledbetter fair pay act of 2009, relaxing the statute of limitations for equal-pay lawsuits. five days later, he signed the reauthorization of the state children's health insurance program (schip) to cover an additional 4â million uninsured children. in march 2009, obama reversed a bush-era policy that had limited funding of embryonic stem cell research and pledged to develop ""strict guidelines"" on the research.

obama appointed two women to serve on the supreme court in the first two years of his presidency. he nominated sonia sotomayor on may 26, 2009 to replace retiring associate justice david souter; she was confirmed on august 6, 2009, becoming the first supreme court justice of hispanic descent. obama nominated elena kagan on may 10, 2010 to replace retiring associate justice john paul stevens. she was confirmed on august 5, 2010, bringing the number of women sitting simultaneously on the court to three justices for the first time in american history.

on march 30, 2010, obama signed the health care and education reconciliation act, a reconciliation bill that ended the process of the federal government giving subsidies to private banks to give out federally insured loans, increased the pell grant scholarship award, and made changes to the patient protection and affordable care act.

in a major space policy speech in april 2010, obama announced a planned change in direction at nasa, the u.s. space agency. he ended plans for a return of human spaceflight to the moon and development of the ares i rocket, ares v rocket and constellation program, in favor of funding earth science projects, a new rocket type, and research and development for an eventual manned mission to mars, and ongoing missions to the international space station.

president obama's 2011 state of the union address focused on themes of education and innovation, stressing the importance of innovation economics to make the united states more competitive globally. he spoke of a five-year freeze in domestic spending, eliminating tax breaks for oil companies and reversing tax cuts for the wealthiest americans, banning congressional earmarks, and reducing healthcare costs. he promised the united states would have one million electric vehicles on the road by 2015 and be 80% reliant on ""clean"" electricity.

on october 8, 2009, obama signed the matthew shepard and james byrd jr. hate crimes prevention act, a measure that expanded the 1969 united states federal hate-crime law to include crimes motivated by a victim's actual or perceived gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability.

on october 30, 2009, obama lifted the ban on travel to the united states by those infected with hiv, which was celebrated by immigration equality.

on december 22, 2010, obama signed the don't ask, don't tell repeal act of 2010, which fulfilled a key promise made in the 2008 presidential campaign to end the don't ask, don't tell policy of 1993 that had prevented gay and lesbian people from serving openly in the united states armed forces. in 2016, the pentagon also ended the policy that barred transgender people from serving openly in the military.

as a candidate for the illinois state senate in 1996, obama had said he favored legalizing same-sex marriage. by the time of his senate run in 2004, he said he supported civil unions and domestic partnerships for same-sex partners but opposed same-sex marriages. in 2008, he reaffirmed this position by stating ""i believe marriage is between a man and a woman. i am not in favor of gay marriage."" on may 9, 2012, shortly after the official launch of his campaign for re-election as president, obama said his views had evolved, and he publicly affirmed his personal support for the legalization of same-sex marriage, becoming the first sitting u.s. president to do so.

during his second inaugural address on january 21, 2013, obama became the first u.s. president in office to call for full equality for gay americans: ""our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law â for if we are truly created equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well."" this was the first time that a president mentioned gay rights or the word ""gay"" in an inaugural address.

in 2013, the obama administration filed briefs that urged the supreme court to rule in favor of same-sex couples in the cases of ""hollingsworth v. perry"" (regarding same-sex marriage) and ""united states v. windsor"" (regarding the defense of marriage act). then, following the supreme court's 2015 decision in ""obergefell v. hodges"" (ruling same-sex marriage to be a fundamental right), obama asserted that, ""this decision affirms what millions of americans already believe in their hearts: when all americans are treated as equal we are all more free.""

on july 30, 2015, the white house office of national aids policy revised its strategy for addressing the disease, which included widespread testing and linkage to healthcare, which was celebrated by the human rights campaign.

on march 11, 2009, obama created the white house council on women and girls, which formed part of the office of intergovernmental affairs, having been established by with a broad mandate to advise him on issues relating to the welfare of american women and girls. the council was chaired by senior advisor to the president valerie jarrett. obama also established the white house task force to protect students from sexual assault through a government memorandum on january 22, 2014, with a broad mandate to advise him on issues relating to sexual assault on college and university campuses throughout the united states. the co-chairs of the task force were vice president joe biden and jarrett. the task force was a development out of the white house council on women and girls and office of the vice president of the united states, and prior to that the 1994 violence against women act first drafted by biden.

on february 17, 2009, obama signed the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009, a $787â billion economic stimulus package aimed at helping the economy recover from the deepening worldwide recession. the act includes increased federal spending for health care, infrastructure, education, various tax breaks and incentives, and direct assistance to individuals.

in march, obama's treasury secretary, timothy geithner, took further steps to manage the financial crisis, including introducing the publicâprivate investment program for legacy assets, which contains provisions for buying up to twoâ trillion dollars in depreciated real estate assets.

obama intervened in the troubled automotive industry in march 2009, renewing loans for general motors and chrysler to continue operations while reorganizing. over the following months the white house set terms for both firms' bankruptcies, including the sale of chrysler to italian automaker fiat and a reorganization of gm giving the u.s. government a temporary 60% equity stake in the company, with the canadian government taking a 12% stake. in june 2009, dissatisfied with the pace of economic stimulus, obama called on his cabinet to accelerate the investment. he signed into law the car allowance rebate system, known colloquially as ""cash for clunkers"", which temporarily boosted the economy.

the bush and obama administrations authorized spending and loan guarantees from the federal reserve and the treasury department. these guarantees totaled about $11.5â trillion, but only $3â trillion had been spent by the end of november 2009. obama and the congressional budget office predicted the 2010 budget deficit would be $1.5â trillion or 10.6% of the nation's gross domestic product (gdp) compared to the 2009 deficit of $1.4â trillion or 9.9% of gdp. for 2011, the administration predicted the deficit would shrink to $1.34â trillion, and the 10-year deficit would increase to $8.53â trillion or 90% of gdp. the most recent increase in the u.s. debt ceiling to $17.2â trillion took effect in february 2014. on august 2, 2011, after a lengthy congressional debate over whether to raise the nation's debt limit, obama signed the bipartisan budget control act of 2011. the legislation enforces limits on discretionary spending until 2021, establishes a procedure to increase the debt limit, creates a congressional joint select committee on deficit reduction to propose further deficit reduction with a stated goal of achieving at least $1.5â trillion in budgetary savings over 10 years, and establishes automatic procedures for reducing spending by as much as $1.2â trillion if legislation originating with the new joint select committee does not achieve such savings. by passing the legislation, congress was able to prevent a u.s. government default on its obligations.

as it did throughout 2008, the unemployment rate rose in 2009, reaching a peak in october at 10.0% and averaging 10.0% in the fourth quarter. following a decrease to 9.7% in the first quarter of 2010, the unemployment rate fell to 9.6% in the second quarter, where it remained for the rest of the year. between february and december 2010, employment rose by 0.8%, which was less than the average of 1.9% experienced during comparable periods in the past four employment recoveries. by november 2012, the unemployment rate fell to 7.7%, decreasing to 6.7% in the last month of 2013. during 2014, the unemployment rate continued to decline, falling to 6.3% in the first quarter. gdp growth returned in the third quarter of 2009, expanding at a rate of 1.6%, followed by a 5.0% increase in the fourth quarter. growth continued in 2010, posting an increase of 3.7% in the first quarter, with lesser gains throughout the rest of the year. in july 2010, the federal reserve noted that economic activity continued to increase, but its pace had slowed, and chairman ben bernanke said the economic outlook was ""unusually uncertain"". overall, the economy expanded at a rate of 2.9% in 2010.

the congressional budget office (cbo) and a broad range of economists credit obama's stimulus plan for economic growth. the cbo released a report stating that the stimulus bill increased employment by 1â2.1â million, while conceding that ""it is impossible to determine how many of the reported jobs would have existed in the absence of the stimulus package."" although an april 2010, survey of members of the national association for business economics showed an increase in job creation (over a similar january survey) for the first time in two years, 73% of 68 respondents believed the stimulus bill has had no impact on employment. the economy of the united states has grown faster than the other original nato members by a wider margin under president obama than it has anytime since the end of world war ii. the organisation for economic co-operation and development credits the much faster growth in the united states to the stimulus plan of the us and the austerity measures in the european union.

within a month of the 2010 midterm elections, obama announced a compromise deal with the congressional republican leadership that included a temporary, two-year extension of the 2001 and 2003 income tax rates, a one-year payroll tax reduction, continuation of unemployment benefits, and a new rate and exemption amount for estate taxes. the compromise overcame opposition from some in both parties, and the resulting $858â billion tax relief, unemployment insurance reauthorization, and job creation act of 2010 passed with bipartisan majorities in both houses of congress before obama signed it on december 17, 2010.

in december 2013, obama declared that growing income inequality is a ""defining challenge of our time"" and called on congress to bolster the safety net and raise wages. this came on the heels of the nationwide strikes of fast-food workers and pope francis' criticism of inequality and trickle-down economics.

obama urged congress to ratify a 12-nation free trade pact called the trans-pacific partnership.

on september 30, 2009, the obama administration proposed new regulations on power plants, factories, and oil refineries in an attempt to limit greenhouse gas emissions and to curb global warming.

on april 20, 2010, an explosion destroyed an offshore drilling rig at the macondo prospect in the gulf of mexico, causing a major sustained oil leak. obama visited the gulf, announced a federal investigation, and formed a bipartisan commission to recommend new safety standards, after a review by secretary of the interior ken salazar and concurrent congressional hearings. he then announced a six-month moratorium on new deepwater drilling permits and leases, pending regulatory review. as multiple efforts by bp failed, some in the media and public expressed confusion and criticism over various aspects of the incident, and stated a desire for more involvement by obama and the federal government.

in july 2013, obama expressed reservations and stated he ""would reject the keystone xl pipeline if it increased carbon pollution"" or ""greenhouse emissions"". obama's advisers called for a halt to petroleum exploration in the arctic in january 2013. on february 24, 2015, obama vetoed a bill that would have authorized the pipeline. it was the third veto of obama's presidency and his first major veto.

obama emphasized the conservation of federal lands during his term in office. he used his power under the antiquities act to create 25 new national monuments during his presidency and expand four others, protecting a total of of federal lands and waters, more than any other u.s. president.

obama called for congress to pass legislation reforming health care in the united states, a key campaign promise and a top legislative goal. he proposed an expansion of health insurance coverage to cover the uninsured, to cap premium increases, and to allow people to retain their coverage when they leave or change jobs. his proposal was to spend $900â billion over 10 years and include a government insurance plan, also known as the public option, to compete with the corporate insurance sector as a main component to lowering costs and improving quality of health care. it would also make it illegal for insurers to drop sick people or deny them coverage for pre-existing conditions, and require every american to carry health coverage. the plan also includes medical spending cuts and taxes on insurance companies that offer expensive plans.

on july 14, 2009, house democratic leaders introduced a 1,017-page plan for overhauling the u.s. health care system, which obama wanted congress to approve by the end of 2009. after much public debate during the congressional summer recess of 2009, obama delivered a speech to a joint session of congress on september 9 where he addressed concerns over the proposals. in march 2009, obama lifted a ban on using federal funds for stem cell research.

on november 7, 2009, a health care bill featuring the public option was passed in the house. on december 24, 2009, the senate passed its own billâwithout a public optionâon a party-line vote of 60â39. on march 21, 2010, the patient protection and affordable care act (aca) passed by the senate in december was passed in the house by a vote of 219 to 212. obama signed the bill into law on march 23, 2010.

the aca includes health-related provisions, most of which took effect in 2014, including expanding medicaid eligibility for people making up to 133%â of the federal poverty level (fpl) starting in 2014, subsidizing insurance premiums for people making up to 400%â of the fpl ($88,000 for family of four in 2010) so their maximum ""out-of-pocket"" payment for annual premiums will be from 2% to 9.5% of income, providing incentives for businesses to provide health care benefits, prohibiting denial of coverage and denial of claims based on pre-existing conditions, establishing health insurance exchanges, prohibiting annual coverage caps, and support for medical research. according to white house and cbo figures, the maximum share of income that enrollees would have to pay would vary depending on their income relative to the federal poverty level.

the costs of these provisions are offset by taxes, fees, and cost-saving measures, such as new medicare taxes for those in high-income brackets, taxes on indoor tanning, cuts to the medicare advantage program in favor of traditional medicare, and fees on medical devices and pharmaceutical companies; there is also a tax penalty for those who do not obtain health insurance, unless they are exempt due to low income or other reasons. in march 2010, the cbo estimated that the net effect of both laws will be a reduction in the federal deficit by $143â billion over the first decade.

the law faced several legal challenges, primarily based on the argument that an individual mandate requiring americans to buy health insurance was unconstitutional. on june 28, 2012, the supreme court ruled by a 5â4 vote in ""national federation of independent business v. sebelius"" that the mandate was constitutional under the u.s. congress's taxing authority. in ""burwell v. hobby lobby"" the court ruled that ""closely-held"" for-profit corporations could be exempt on religious grounds under the religious freedom restoration act from regulations adopted under the aca that would have required them to pay for insurance that covered certain contraceptives. in june 2015, the court ruled 6â3 in ""king v. burwell"" that subsidies to help individuals and families purchase health insurance were authorized for those doing so on both the federal exchange and state exchanges, not only those purchasing plans ""established by the state"", as the statute reads.

prior to june 2014, obama offered substantial support for a broadly-based ""all of the above"" approach to domestic energy policy, which obama has maintained since his first term and which he last confirmed at his state of the union speech in january 2014 to a mixed reception by both parties. in june 2014, obama made indications that his administration would consider a shift towards an energy policy more closely tuned to the manufacturing industry and its impact on the domestic economy. obama's approach of selectively combining regulation and incentive to various issues in the domestic energy policy, such as coal mining and oil fracking, has received mixed commentary for not being as responsive to the needs of the domestic manufacturing sector as needed, following claims that the domestic manufacturing sector utilizes as much as a third of the nation's available energy resources.

on january 16, 2013, one month after the sandy hook elementary school shooting, obama signed 23 executive orders and outlined a series of sweeping proposals regarding gun control. he urged congress to reintroduce an expired ban on military-style assault weapons, such as those used in several recent mass shootings, impose limits on ammunition magazines to 10 rounds, introduce background checks on all gun sales, pass a ban on possession and sale of armor-piercing bullets, introduce harsher penalties for gun-traffickers, especially unlicensed dealers who buy arms for criminals and approving the appointment of the head of the federal bureau of alcohol, tobacco, firearms and explosives for the first time since 2006. on january 5, 2016, obama announced new executive actions extending background check requirements to more gun sellers. in a 2016 editorial in the ""new york times"", obama compared the struggle for what he termed ""common-sense gun reform"" to women's suffrage and other civil rights movements in american history.

obama called the november 2, 2010 election, where the democratic party lost 63 seats in, and control of, the house of representatives, ""humbling"" and a ""shellacking"". he said that the results came because not enough americans had felt the effects of the economic recovery.

on november 10, 2014, president obama recommended the federal communications commission reclassify broadband internet service as a telecommunications service in order to preserve net neutrality. on february 12, 2013, president obama signed , ""improving critical infrastructure cybersecurity.""

in 2005 and 2006, obama criticized certain aspects of the patriot act for infringing too much on civil liberties and sought as senator to strengthen civil liberties protections. in 2006, he voted to reauthorize a revised version of the patriot act, saying the law was not ideal but that the revised version had strengthened civil liberties. in 2011, he signed a four-year renewal of the patriot act. following the 2013 global surveillance disclosures by whistleblower edward snowden, obama condemned the leak as unpatriotic, but called for increased restrictions on the nsa to address violations of privacy. the changes which obama ordered have been described as ""modest"" however.

in february and march 2009, vice president joe biden and secretary of state hillary clinton made separate overseas trips to announce a ""new era"" in u.s. foreign relations with russia and europe, using the terms ""break"" and ""reset"" to signal major changes from the policies of the preceding administration. obama attempted to reach out to arab leaders by granting his first interview to an arab satellite tv network, al arabiya.

on march 19, obama continued his outreach to the muslim world, releasing a new year's video message to the people and government of iran. in april, obama gave a speech in ankara, turkey, which was well received by many arab governments. on june 4, 2009, obama delivered a speech at cairo university in egypt calling for ""a new beginning"" in relations between the islamic world and the united states and promoting middle east peace.

on june 26, 2009, obama responded to the iranian government's actions towards protesters following iran's 2009 presidential election by saying: ""the violence perpetrated against them is outrageous. we see it and we condemn it."" while in moscow on july 7, he responded to vice president biden's comment on a possible israeli military strike on iran by saying: ""we have said directly to the israelis that it is important to try and resolve this in an international setting in a way that does not create major conflict in the middle east.""

on september 24, 2009, obama became the first sitting u.s. president to preside over a meeting of the united nations security council.

in march 2010, obama took a public stance against plans by the government of israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu to continue building jewish housing projects in predominantly arab neighborhoods of east jerusalem. during the same month, an agreement was reached with the administration of russian president dmitry medvedev to replace the 1991 strategic arms reduction treaty with a new pact reducing the number of long-range nuclear weapons in the arsenals of both countries by about a third. obama and medvedev signed the new start treaty in april 2010, and the u.s. senate ratified it in december 2010.

in december 2011, obama instructed agencies to consider lgbt rights when issuing financial aid to foreign countries. in august 2013, he criticized russia's law that discriminates against gays, but he stopped short of advocating a boycott of the upcoming 2014 winter olympics in sochi, russia.

in december 2014, obama announced that he intended to normalize relationships between cuba and the united states. the countries' respective ""interests sections"" in one another's capitals were upgraded to embassies on july 20, 2015.

in march 2015, obama declared that he had authorized u.s. forces to provide logistical and intelligence support to the saudis in their military intervention in yemen, establishing a ""joint planning cell"" with saudi arabia. in 2016, the obama administration proposed a series of arms deals with saudi arabia worth $115 billion. obama halted the sale of guided munition technology to saudi arabia after saudi warplanes targeted a funeral in yemen's capital sanaa, killing more than 140 people.

before leaving office, obama said german chancellor angela merkel had been his ""closest international partner"" throughout his tenure as president.

on february 27, 2009, obama announced that combat operations in iraq would end within 18 months. his remarks were made to a group of marines preparing for deployment to afghanistan. obama said, ""let me say this as plainly as i can: by august 31, 2010, our combat mission in iraq will end."" the obama administration scheduled the withdrawal of combat troops to be completed by august 2010, decreasing troop's levels from 142,000 while leaving a transitional force of about 50,000 in iraq until the end of 2011. on august 19, 2010, the last u.s. combat brigade exited iraq. remaining troops transitioned from combat operations to counter-terrorism and the training, equipping, and advising of iraqi security forces. on august 31, 2010, obama announced that the united states combat mission in iraq was over. on october 21, 2011 president obama announced that all u.s. troops would leave iraq in time to be ""home for the holidays"".

in june 2014, following the capture of mosul by isis, obama sent 275 troops to provide support and security for u.s. personnel and the u.s. embassy in baghdad. isis continued to gain ground and to commit widespread massacres and ethnic cleansing.

in august 2014, during the sinjar massacre, obama ordered a campaign of u.s. airstrikes against isis.

by the end of 2014, 3,100 american ground troops were committed to the conflict and 16,000 sorties were flown over the battlefield, primarily by u.s. air force and navy pilots.

in early 2015, with the addition of the ""panther brigade"" of the 82nd airborne division the number of u.s. ground troops in iraq surged to 4,400, and by july american-led coalition air forces counted 44,000 sorties over the battlefield.

early in his presidency, obama moved to bolster u.s. troop strength in afghanistan. he announced an increase in u.s. troop levels to 17,000 military personnel in february 2009 to ""stabilize a deteriorating situation in afghanistan"", an area he said had not received the ""strategic attention, direction and resources it urgently requires"". he replaced the military commander in afghanistan, general david d. mckiernan, with former special forces commander lt. gen. stanley a. mcchrystal in may 2009, indicating that mcchrystal's special forces experience would facilitate the use of counterinsurgency tactics in the war. on december 1, 2009, obama announced the deployment of an additional 30,000 military personnel to afghanistan and proposed to begin troop withdrawals 18 months from that date; this took place in july 2011. david petraeus replaced mcchrystal in june 2010, after mcchrystal's staff criticized white house personnel in a magazine article. in february 2013, obama said the u.s. military would reduce the troop level in afghanistan from 68,000 to 34,000 u.s. troops by february 2014.

in october 2015, the white house announced a plan to keep u.s. forces in afghanistan indefinitely in light of the deteriorating security situation.

in 2011, the united states vetoed a security council resolution condemning israeli settlements, with the united states being the only nation to do so. obama supports the two-state solution to the arabâisraeli conflict based on the 1967 borders with land swaps.

in june 2011, obama said the bond between the united states and israel is ""unbreakable"". during the initial years of the obama administration, the u.s. increased military cooperation with israel, including increased military aid, re-establishment of the u.s.-israeli joint political military group and the defense policy advisory group, and an increase in visits among high-level military officials of both countries. the obama administration asked congress to allocate money toward funding the iron dome program in response to the waves of palestinian rocket attacks on israel.

in 2013, jeffrey goldberg reported that, in obama's view, ""with each new settlement announcement, netanyahu is moving his country down a path toward near-total isolation."" in 2014, obama likened the zionist movement to the civil rights movement in the united states. he said both movements seek to bring justice and equal rights to historically persecuted peoples. he explained, ""to me, being pro-israel and pro-jewish is part and parcel with the values that i've been fighting for since i was politically conscious and started getting involved in politics."" obama expressed support for israel's right to defend itself during the 2014 israelâgaza conflict. in 2015, obama was harshly criticized by israel for advocating and signing the iran nuclear deal; israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu, who had advocated the u.s. congress to oppose it, said the deal was ""dangerous"" and ""bad"".

on december 23, 2016, under the obama administration, the united states abstained from united nations security council resolution 2334, which condemned israeli settlement building in the occupied palestinian territories as a violation of international law, effectively allowing it to pass. netanyahu strongly criticized the obama administration's actions, and the israeli government withdrew its annual dues from the organization, which totaled $6 million, on january 6, 2017. on january 5, 2017, the united states house of representatives voted 342â80 to condemn the un resolution.

in february 2011, protests in libya began against long-time dictator muammar gaddafi as part of the arab spring. they soon turned violent. in march, as forces loyal to gaddafi advanced on rebels across libya, calls for a no-fly zone came from around the world, including europe, the arab league, and a resolution passed unanimously by the u.s. senate. in response to the unanimous passage of united nations security council resolution 1973 on march 17, gaddafiâwho had previously vowed to ""show no mercy"" to the rebels of benghaziâannounced an immediate cessation of military activities, yet reports came in that his forces continued shelling misrata. the next day, on obama's orders, the u.s. military took part in air strikes to destroy the libyan government's air defense capabilities to protect civilians and enforce a no-fly-zone, including the use of tomahawk missiles, b-2 spirits, and fighter jets. six days later, on march 25, by unanimous vote of all its 28 members, nato took over leadership of the effort, dubbed operation unified protector. some representatives questioned whether obama had the constitutional authority to order military action in addition to questioning its cost, structure and aftermath.

on august 18, 2011, several months after the start of the syrian civil war, obama issued a written statement that said: ""the time has come for president assad to step aside."" this stance was reaffirmed in november 2015. in 2012, obama authorized multiple programs run by the cia and the pentagon to train anti-assad rebels. the pentagon-run program was later found to have failed and was formally abandoned in october 2015.

in the wake of a chemical weapons attack in syria, formally blamed by the obama administration on the assad government, obama chose not to enforce the ""red line"" he had pledged and, rather than authorize the promised military action against assad, went along with the russia-brokered deal that led to assad giving up chemical weapons; however attacks with chlorine gas continued. in 2014, obama authorized an air campaign aimed primarily at isil, but repeatedly promised the u.s. would not deploy ground troops in syria.

starting with information received from central intelligence agency operatives in july 2010, the cia developed intelligence over the next several months that determined what they believed to be the hideout of osama bin laden. he was living in seclusion in a large compound in abbottabad, pakistan, a suburban area from islamabad. cia head leon panetta reported this intelligence to president obama in march 2011. meeting with his national security advisers over the course of the next six weeks, obama rejected a plan to bomb the compound, and authorized a ""surgical raid"" to be conducted by united states navy seals. the operation took place on may 1, 2011, and resulted in the shooting death of bin laden and the seizure of papers, computer drives and disks from the compound. dna testing was one of five methods used to positively identify bin laden's corpse, which was buried at sea several hours later. within minutes of the president's announcement from washington, dc, late in the evening on may 1, there were spontaneous celebrations around the country as crowds gathered outside the white house, and at new york city's ground zero and times square. reaction to the announcement was positive across party lines, including from former presidents bill clinton and george w. bush.

in november 2013, the obama administration opened negotiations with iran to prevent it from acquiring nuclear weapons, which included an interim agreement. negotiations took two years with numerous delays, with a deal being announced july 14, 2015. the deal, titled the ""joint comprehensive plan of action"", saw the removal of sanctions in exchange for measures that would prevent iran from producing nuclear weapons. while obama hailed the agreement as being a step towards a more hopeful world, the deal drew strong criticism from republican and conservative quarters, and from israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu. in addition, the transfer of $1.7 billion in cash to iran shortly after the deal was announced was criticized by the republican party. the obama administration said that the payment in cash was because of the ""effectiveness of u.s. and international sanctions"". in order to advance the deal, the obama administration shielded hezbollah from the drug enforcement administration's project cassandra investigation regarding drug smuggling and from the central intelligence agency.

since the spring of 2013, secret meetings were conducted between the united states and cuba in the neutral locations of canada and vatican city. the vatican first became involved in 2013 when pope francis advised the u.s. and cuba to exchange prisoners as a gesture of goodwill. on december 10, 2013, cuban president raãºl castro, in a significant public moment, greeted and shook hands with obama at the nelson mandela memorial service in johannesburg.

in december 2014, after the secret meetings, it was announced that obama, with pope francis as an intermediary, had negotiated a restoration of relations with cuba, after nearly sixty years of dã©tente. popularly dubbed the cuban thaw, ""the new republic"" deemed the cuban thaw to be ""obama's finest foreign policy achievement."" on july 1, 2015, president barack obama announced that formal diplomatic relations between cuba and the united states would resume, and embassies would be opened in washington and havana. the countries' respective ""interests sections"" in one another's capitals were upgraded to embassies on july 20 and august 13, 2015, respectively.

obama visited havana, cuba for two days in march 2016, becoming the first sitting u.s. president to arrive since calvin coolidge in 1928.

obama spoke in front of the african union in addis ababa, ethiopia, on july 29, 2015, the first sitting u.s. president to do so. he gave a speech encouraging the world to increase economic ties via investments and trade with the continent, and lauded the progress made in education, infrastructure, and economy. he also criticized the lack of democracy and leaders who refuse to step aside, discrimination against minorities (lgbt people, religious groups and ethnicities), and corruption. he suggested an intensified democratization and free trade, to significantly improve the quality of life for africans. during his july 2015 trip, obama also was the first u.s. president ever to visit kenya, which is the homeland of his father.

on may 27, 2016, obama became the first sitting american president to visit hiroshima, japan, 71 years after the u.s. atomic bombing of hiroshima that ended world war ii. accompanied by japanese prime minister shinzå abe, obama paid tribute to the victims of the bombing at the hiroshima peace memorial museum.

after russia's invasion of crimea in 2014, military intervention in syria in 2015, and the interference in the 2016 u.s. presidential election, obama's russia policy was widely seen as a failure. george robertson, a former uk defense secretary and nato secretary-general, said obama had ""allowed putin to jump back on the world stage and test the resolve of the west"", adding that the legacy of this disaster would last.

obama's family history, upbringing, and ivy league education differ markedly from those of african-american politicians who launched their careers in the 1960s through participation in the civil rights movement. expressing puzzlement over questions about whether he is ""black enough"", obama told an august 2007 meeting of the national association of black journalists that ""we're still locked in this notion that if you appeal to white folks then there must be something wrong."" obama acknowledged his youthful image in an october 2007 campaign speech, saying: ""i wouldn't be here if, time and again, the torch had not been passed to a new generation.""

obama is frequently referred to as an exceptional orator. during his pre-inauguration transition period and continuing into his presidency, obama delivered a series of weekly internet video addresses. in his speeches as president, obama did not make more overt references to race relations than his predecessors, but according to one study, he implemented stronger policy action on behalf of african-americans than any president since the nixon era.

according to the gallup organization, obama began his presidency with a 68% approval rating before gradually declining for the rest of the year, and eventually bottoming out at 41% in august 2010, a trend similar to ronald reagan's and bill clinton's first years in office. he experienced a small poll bounce shortly after the death of osama bin laden on may 2, 2011. this bounce lasted until around june 2011, when his approval numbers dropped back to where they were previously. his approval ratings rebounded around the same time as his reelection in 2012, with polls showing an average job approval of 52% shortly after his second inauguration. despite approval ratings dropping to 39% in late-2013 due to the aca roll-out, they climbed to 50% in january 2015 according to gallup.

polls showed strong support for obama in other countries both before and during his presidency. in a february 2009 poll conducted in western europe and the u.s. by harris interactive for france 24 and the ""international herald tribune"", obama was rated as the most respected world leader, as well as the most powerful. in a similar poll conducted by harris in may 2009, obama was rated as the most popular world leader, as well as the one figure most people would pin their hopes on for pulling the world out of the economic downturn.

obama won best spoken word album grammy awards for abridged audiobook versions of ""dreams from my father"" in february 2006 and for ""the audacity of hope"" in february 2008. his concession speech after the new hampshire primary was set to music by independent artists as the music video ""yes we can"", which was viewed 10â million times on youtube in its first month and received a daytime emmy award. in december 2008 and in 2012, ""time"" magazine named obama as its person of the year. the 2008 awarding was for his historic candidacy and election, which ""time"" described as ""the steady march of seemingly impossible accomplishments"". on may 25, 2011, obama became the first president of the united states to address both houses of the uk parliament in westminster hall, london. this was only the fifth occurrence since the start of the 20th century of a head of state's being extended this invitation, following charles de gaulle in 1960, nelson mandela in 1996, queen elizabeth ii in 2002 and pope benedict xvi in 2010.
on october 9, 2009, the norwegian nobel committee announced that obama had won the 2009 nobel peace prize ""for his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples"". obama accepted this award in oslo, norway on december 10, 2009, with ""deep gratitude and great humility."" the award drew a mixture of praise and criticism from world leaders and media figures. obama's peace prize was called a ""stunning surprise"" by ""the new york times"". obama is the fourth u.s. president to be awarded the nobel peace prize and the third to become a nobel laureate while in office. obama's nobel prize has been viewed skeptically in subsequent years, especially after the director of the nobel institute, geir lundestad, said obama's peace prize did not have the desired effect.

obama's presidency ended at noon on january 20, 2017, immediately following the inauguration of his republican successor, donald trump. after the inauguration, obama lifted off on executive one, circled the white house, and flew to joint base andrews. the family currently rents a house in kalorama, washington, d.c.

on march 2, 2017, the john f. kennedy presidential library and museum awarded the annual profile in courage award to obama ""for his enduring commitment to democratic ideals and elevating the standard of political courage."" in his first public appearance out of office, obama appeared at a seminar at the university of chicago on april 24. the seminar was aimed at the engagement with a new generation as well as an appeal for their participation in politics. on may 4, three days ahead of the french presidential election, obama publicly endorsed emmanuel macron: ""he appeals to people's hopes and not their fears, and i enjoyed speaking to emmanuel recently to hear about his independent movement and his vision for the future of france."" macron went on to win the election.

while in berlin on may 25, obama made a joint public appearance with chancellor angela merkel where he stressed inclusion and for leaders to question themselves, obama having been formally invited to berlin while still in office as part of an effort to boost merkel's re-election campaign. obama traveled to kensington palace in england and met with prince harry on may 27, 2017; obama tweeted afterward that the two discussed their foundations and offering condolences in the wake of the manchester arena bombing that occurred five days prior.

after president trump announced his withdrawal of the united states from the paris agreement on june 1, obama released a statement disagreeing with the choice: ""but even in the absence of american leadership; even as this administration joins a small handful of nations that reject the future; i'm confident that our states, cities, and businesses will step up and do even more to lead the way, and help protect for future generations the one planet we've got.""
after senate republicans revealed the better care reconciliation act of 2017, their discussion draft of a health care bill to replace the affordable care act, on june 22, obama released a facebook post calling the bill ""a massive transfer of wealth from middle-class and poor families to the richest people in america."" on september 19, while delivering the keynote address at goalkeepers, obama admitted his frustration with republicans backing ""a bill that will raise costs, reduce coverage, and roll back protections for older americans and people with pre-existing conditions"".

after attorney general jeff sessions announced the termination of the deferred action for childhood arrivals (daca) program on september 5, obama released a facebook post rebuking the decision. two days later, he partnered with former presidents jimmy carter, george h. w. bush, bill clinton, and george w. bush to work with one america appeal to help the victims of hurricane harvey and hurricane irma in the gulf coast and texas communities.

obama hosted the inaugural summit of the obama foundation in chicago on october 31. obama intends for the foundation to be the central focus of his post-presidency and part of his ambitions for his subsequent activities following his presidency to be more consequential than his time in office. obama has also been working on a presidential memoir, in a reported $65 million deal with penguin random house.

obama went on an international trip from november 28 to december 2, 2017, and visited china, india and france. in china, he delivered remarks at the global alliance of smes summit in shanghai and met with chinese president xi jinping in beijing. he then went to india, where he spoke at the hindustan times leadership summit before meeting with indian prime minister narendra modi over lunch. in addition, he held a town hall for young leaders, organized by the obama foundation. he also met with the dalai lama while in new delhi. he ended his five-day trip in france where he met with french president emmanuel macron, former president francois hollande and paris mayor anne hidalgo and then spoke at an invitation-only event, touching on climate issues.

barack and michelle obama signed a deal on may 22, 2018 to produce docu-series, documentaries and features for netflix under the obama's newly formed production company, higher ground productions. on the deal, michelle said ""i have always believed in the power of storytelling to inspire us, to make us think differently about the world around us, and to help us open our minds and hearts to others"".

a package that contained a pipe bomb was sent to obama's home in washington, d.c, on october 24, 2018. the package was intercepted by the secret service during routine mail screenings. similar packages were sent to several other democratic leaders, mostly those who voiced strong objections to the policies of donald trump and to cnn. debbie wasserman schultz was addressed as the sender of the package. on october 26, 2018, cesar sayoc was arrested and faces five federal charges in manhattan carrying a combined maximum sentence of 48 years behind bars in relation to the pipe bombs.

obama's most significant legacy is generally considered to be the patient protection and affordable care act (ppaca), provisions of which went into effect from 2010 to 2020. many attempts by senate republicans to repeal the ppaca, including a ""skinny repeal"", have thus far failed. together with the health care and education reconciliation act amendment, it represents the u.s. healthcare system's most significant regulatory overhaul and expansion of coverage since the passage of medicare and medicaid in 1965.

many commentators credit obama with averting a threatened depression and pulling the economy back from the great recession. according to the u.s. bureau of labor statistics, the obama administration created 11.3â million jobs from the month after his first inauguration to the end of his term. in 2010, obama signed into effect the doddâfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act. passed as a response to the financial crisis of 2007â08, it brought the most significant changes to financial regulation in the united states since the regulatory reform that followed the great depression under democratic president franklin d. roosevelt.

in 2009, obama signed into law the national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2010, which contained in it the matthew shepard and james byrd jr. hate crimes prevention act, the first addition to existing federal hate crime law in the united states since democratic president bill clinton signed into law the church arson prevention act of 1996. the matthew shepard and james byrd jr. hate crimes prevention act expanded existing federal hate crime laws in the united states to apply to crimes motivated by a victim's actual or perceived gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability, and dropped the prerequisite that the victim be engaging in a federally protected activity.

as president, obama advanced lgbt rights. in 2010, he signed the don't ask, don't tell repeal act, which brought an end to ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy in the u.s. armed forces that banned open service from lgb people; the law went into effect the following year. in 2016, his administration brought an end to the ban on transgender people serving openly in the u.s. armed forces. a gallup poll, taken in the final days of obama's term, showed that 68% of americans believed the u.s. had made progress in the situation for gays and lesbians during obama's eight years in office.

obama substantially escalated the use of drone strikes against suspected militants and terrorists associated with al-qaeda and the taliban. in 2016, the last year of his presidency, the us dropped 26,171 bombs on seven different countries. obama left about 8,400 us troops in afghanistan, 5,262 in iraq, 503 in syria, 133 in pakistan, 106 in somalia, seven in yemen, and two in libya at the end of his presidency.

according to pew research center and united states bureau of justice statistics, from december 31, 2009, to december 31, 2015, inmates sentenced in us federal custody declined by five percent. this is the largest decline in sentenced inmates in us federal custody since democratic president jimmy carter. by contrast, the federal prison population increased significantly under presidents ronald reagan, george h. w. bush, bill clinton, and george w. bush.

obama left office in january 2017 with a 60% approval rating. a 2018 survey of historians by the american political science association ranked obama the 8th-greatest american president. obama gained 10 spots from the same survey in 2015 from the brookings institution that ranked obama the 18th-greatest american president.
the barack obama presidential center is obama's planned presidential library. it will be hosted by the university of chicago and located in jackson park on the south side of chicago.
"
vladimir putin,"
vladimir vladimirovich putin (; ; born 7 october 1952) is the president of russia since 2012, previously holding the position from 2000 until 2008. in between his presidential terms, he was also the prime minister of russia under president dmitry medvedev.

putin was born in leningrad and studied law at leningrad state university, graduating in 1975. putin was a kgb foreign intelligence officer for 16 years, rising to the rank of lieutenant colonel before resigning in 1991 to enter politics in saint petersburg. he moved to moscow in 1996 and joined president boris yeltsin's administration where he served as director of the fsb, the kgb's successor agency, and then as prime minister. he became acting president on 31 december 1999, when yeltsin resigned.

during his first presidency, the russian economy grew for eight straight years, and gdp measured in purchasing power increased by 72%. the growth was a result of the 2000s commodities boom, recovery from the post-communist depression and financial crises, and prudent economic and fiscal policies. in september 2011, putin announced he would seek a third term as president. he won the march 2012 presidential election with 64% of the vote. falling oil prices coupled with international sanctions imposed at the beginning of 2014 after russia's annexation of crimea and military intervention in eastern ukraine led to gdp shrinking by 3.7% in 2015, though the russian economy rebounded in 2016 with 0.3% gdp growth and the recession officially ended. putin gained 76% of the march 2018 presidential vote and was re-elected for a six-year term that will end in 2024.

under putin's leadership, russia has experienced democratic backsliding. experts do not generally consider russia to be a democracy, citing purges and jailing of political opponents, curtailed press freedom, and the lack of free and fair elections. russia has scored poorly in transparency international's ""corruption perceptions index"" and experienced democratic backsliding according to both the economist intelligence unit's ""democracy index"" and freedom house's ""freedom in the world"" index (including a record low 20/100 rating in the 2017 freedom in the world report, a rating not given since the time of the soviet union). human rights organizations and activists have accused putin of persecuting political critics and activists, as well as ordering them tortured or assassinated; he has rejected accusations of human rights abuses. officials of the united states government have accused him of leading an interference program against hillary clinton in support of donald trump during the u.s. presidential election in 2016, an allegation which both trump and putin have frequently denied and criticized.

vladimir vladimirovich putin was born on 7 october 1952 in leningrad, russian sfsr, soviet union (now saint petersburg), the youngest of three children of vladimir spiridonovich putin (1911â1999) and maria ivanovna putina ("""" shelomova; 1911â1998). vladimir spiridonovich's father was cook to vladimir lenin. putin's birth was preceded by the death of two brothers, viktor and albert, born in the mid-1930s. albert died in infancy and viktor died of diphtheria during the siege of leningrad in world war ii. putin's mother was a factory worker and his father was a conscript in the soviet navy, serving in the submarine fleet in the early 1930s. early in world war ii, his father served in the destruction battalion of the nkvd. later, he was transferred to the regular army and was severely wounded in 1942. putin's maternal grandmother was killed by the german occupiers of tver region in 1941, and his maternal uncles disappeared at the war front.

on 1 september 1960, putin started at school no. 193 at baskov lane, near his home. he was one of a few in the class of approximately 45 pupils who was not yet a member of the young pioneer organization. at age 12, he began to practice sambo and judo. he is a judo black belt and national master of sports in sambo. he wished to emulate the intelligence officers portrayed in soviet cinema. putin studied german at saint petersburg high school 281 and speaks german fluently.

putin studied law at the leningrad state university (now saint petersburg state university) in 1970 and graduated in 1975. his thesis was on ""the most favored nation trading principle in international law"". while there, he was required to join the communist party of the soviet union and remained a member until december 1991. putin met anatoly sobchak, an assistant professor who taught business law, was co-author of the russian constitution, and who would be influential in putin's career.

in 1975, putin joined the kgb and trained at the 401st kgb school in okhta, leningrad. after training, he worked in the second chief directorate (counter-intelligence), before he was transferred to the first chief directorate, where he monitored foreigners and consular officials in leningrad. in september 1984, putin was sent to moscow for further training at the yuri andropov red banner institute. from 1985 to 1990 he served in dresden, east germany, using a cover identity as a translator. masha gessen, a russian-american who has authored a biography about putin, claims ""putin and his colleagues were reduced mainly to collecting press clippings, thus contributing to the mountains of useless information produced by the kgb"". according to putin's official biography, during the fall of the berlin wall that began on 9 november 1989, he burned kgb files to prevent demonstrators from obtaining them.

after the collapse of the communist east german government, putin returned to leningrad in early 1990, where he worked for about three months with the international affairs section of leningrad state university, reporting to vice-rector yuriy molchanov. there, he looked for new kgb recruits, watched the student body, and renewed his friendship with his former professor, anatoly sobchak, soon to be the mayor of leningrad. putin claims that he resigned with the rank of lieutenant colonel on 20 august 1991, on the second day of the 1991 soviet coup d'ã©tat attempt against the soviet president mikhail gorbachev. putin said: ""as soon as the coup began, i immediately decided which side i was on"", although he also noted that the choice was hard because he had spent the best part of his life with ""the organs"".

in 1999, putin described communism as ""a blind alley, far away from the mainstream of civilization"".

in may 1990, putin was appointed as an advisor on international affairs to the mayor of leningrad anatoly sobchak. in a 2017 interview with oliver stone, putin said that he resigned from the kgb in 1991, following the coup against mikhail gorbachev, as he did not agree with what had happened and did not want to be part of the intelligence in the new administration. he described this in the putin interviews.

on 28 june 1991, he became head of the committee for external relations of the mayor's office, with responsibility for promoting international relations and foreign investments and registering business ventures. within a year, putin was investigated by the city legislative council led by marina salye. it was concluded that he had understated prices and permitted the export of metals valued at $93â million in exchange for foreign food aid that never arrived. despite the investigators' recommendation that putin be fired, putin remained head of the committee for external relations until 1996. from 1994 to 1996, he held several other political and governmental positions in saint petersburg.

in march 1994, putin was appointed as first deputy chairman of the government of saint petersburg. in may 1995, he organized the saint petersburg branch of the pro-government our home â russia political party, the liberal party of power founded by prime minister viktor chernomyrdin. in 1995, he managed the legislative election campaign for that party, and from 1995 through june 1997, he was the leader of its saint petersburg branch.

in june 1996, sobchak lost his bid for reelection in saint petersburg, so putin moved to moscow and was appointed as deputy chief of the headed by pavel borodin. he occupied this position until march 1997. during his tenure, putin was responsible for the foreign property of the state and organized the transfer of the former assets of the soviet union and communist party to the russian federation.

on 26 march 1997, president boris yeltsin appointed putin deputy chief of presidential staff, which he remained until may 1998, and chief of the main control directorate of the presidential property management department (until june 1998). his predecessor on this position was alexei kudrin and the successor was nikolai patrushev, both future prominent politicians and putin's associates.

on 27 june 1997, at the saint petersburg mining institute, guided by rector vladimir litvinenko, putin defended his candidate of science dissertation in economics, titled ""the strategic planning of regional resources under the formation of market relations"". this exemplified the custom in russia for a rising young official to write a scholarly work in mid-career. when putin later became president, the dissertation became a target of plagiarism accusations by fellows at the brookings institution; although the dissertation was referenced, the brookings fellows asserted that it constituted plagiarism albeit perhaps unintentional. the dissertation committee denied the accusations.

on 25 may 1998, putin was appointed first deputy chief of presidential staff for regions, replacing viktoriya mitina; and, on 15 july, he was appointed head of the commission for the preparation of agreements on the delimitation of power of regions and the federal center attached to the president, replacing sergey shakhray. after putin's appointment, the commission completed no such agreements, although during shakhray's term as the head of the commission 46 agreements were signed. later, after becoming president, putin canceled all those agreements.

on 25 july 1998, yeltsin appointed putin as director of the federal security service (fsb), the primary intelligence and security organization of the russian federation and the successor to the kgb.

on 9 august 1999, putin was appointed one of three first deputy prime ministers, and later on that day, was appointed acting prime minister of the government of the russian federation by president yeltsin. yeltsin also announced that he wanted to see putin as his successor. later on that same day, putin agreed to run for the presidency.

on 16 august, the state duma approved his appointment as prime minister with 233 votes in favor (vs. 84 against, 17 abstained), while a simple majority of 226 was required, making him russia's fifth pm in fewer than eighteen months. on his appointment, few expected putin, virtually unknown to the general public, to last any longer than his predecessors. he was initially regarded as a yeltsin loyalist; like other prime ministers of boris yeltsin, putin did not choose ministers himself, his cabinet was determined by the presidential administration.

yeltsin's main opponents and would-be successors were already campaigning to replace the ailing president, and they fought hard to prevent putin's emergence as a potential successor. following the russian apartment bombings, putin's law-and-order image and unrelenting approach to the second chechen war against the chechen republic of ichkeria soon combined to raise his popularity and allowed him to overtake his rivals.

while not formally associated with any party, putin pledged his support to the newly formed unity party, which won the second largest percentage of the popular vote (23.3%) in the december 1999 duma elections, and in turn supported putin.

on 31 december 1999, yeltsin unexpectedly resigned and, according to the constitution of russia, putin became acting president of the russian federation. on assuming this role, putin went on a previously scheduled visit to russian troops in chechnya.

the first presidential decree that putin signed, on 31 december 1999, was titled ""on guarantees for former president of the russian federation and members of his family"". this ensured that ""corruption charges against the outgoing president and his relatives"" would not be pursued. this was most notably targeted at the mabetex bribery case in which yeltsin's family members were involved. on 30 august 2000, a criminal investigation (number 18/238278-95) was dropped in which putin himself was one of the suspects as a member of the saint petersburg city government. on 30 december 2000, yet another case against the prosecutor general was dropped ""for lack of evidence"", in spite of thousands of documents passed by swiss prosecution. on 12 february 2001, putin signed a similar federal law which replaced the decree of 1999. a case regarding putin's alleged corruption in metal exports from 1992 was brought back by marina salye, but she was silenced and forced to leave saint petersburg.

while his opponents had been preparing for an election in june 2000, yeltsin's resignation resulted in the presidential elections being held within three months, on 26 march 2000; putin won in the first round with 53% of the vote.

the inauguration of president putin occurred on 7 may 2000. putin appointed the minister of finance, mikhail kasyanov, as the prime minister.

the first major challenge to putin's popularity came in august 2000, when he was criticized for the alleged mishandling of the ""kursk"" submarine disaster. that criticism was largely because it was several days before putin returned from vacation, and several more before he visited the scene.

between 2000 and 2004, putin set about the reconstruction of the impoverished condition of the country, apparently winning a power-struggle with the russian oligarchs, reaching a 'grand bargain' with them. this bargain allowed the oligarchs to maintain most of their powers, in exchange for their explicit support forâand alignment withâputin's government.

in 2003, a referendum was held in chechnya, adopting a new constitution which declares that the republic of chechnya is a part of russia; on the other hand, the region did acquire autonomy. chechnya has been gradually stabilized with the establishment of the parliamentary elections and a regional government. throughout the second chechen war, russia severely disabled the chechen rebel movement; however, sporadic attacks by rebels continued to occur throughout the northern caucasus.

on 14 march 2004, putin was elected to the presidency for a second term, receiving 71% of the vote. the beslan school hostage crisis took place in september 2004, in which hundreds died. many in the russian press and in the international media warned that the death of 130 hostages in the special forces' rescue operation during the 2002 moscow theater hostage crisis would severely damage president putin's popularity. however, shortly after the siege had ended, the russian president enjoyed record public approval ratings â 83% of russians declared themselves satisfied with putin and his handling of the siege.

the near 10-year period prior to the rise of putin after the dissolution of soviet rule was a time of upheaval in russia. in a 2005 kremlin speech, putin characterized the collapse of the soviet union as the ""greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the twentieth century."" putin elaborated ""moreover, the epidemic of disintegration infected russia itself."" the country's cradle-to-grave social safety net was gone and life expectancy declined in the period preceding putin's rule. in 2005, the national priority projects were launched to improve russia's health care, education, housing and agriculture.
the continued criminal prosecution of russia's then richest man, president of yukos oil and gas company mikhail khodorkovsky, for fraud and tax evasion was seen by the international press as a retaliation for khodorkovsky's donations to both liberal and communist opponents of the kremlin. the government said that khodorkovsky was ""corrupting"" a large segment of the duma to prevent changes to the tax code. khodorkovsky was arrested, yukos was bankrupted and the company's assets were auctioned at below-market value, with the largest share acquired by the state company rosneft. the fate of yukos was seen as a sign of a broader shift of russia towards a system of state capitalism. this was underscored in july 2014 when shareholders of yukos were awarded $50 billion in compensation by the permanent arbitration court in the hague.

on 7 october 2006, anna politkovskaya, a journalist who exposed corruption in the russian army and its conduct in chechnya, was shot in the lobby of her apartment building, on putin's birthday. the death of politkovskaya triggered international criticism, with accusations that putin has failed to protect the country's new independent media. putin himself said that her death caused the government more problems than her writings.
in 2007, ""dissenters' marches"" were organized by the opposition group the other russia, led by former chess champion garry kasparov and national-bolshevist leader eduard limonov. following prior warnings, demonstrations in several russian cities were met by police action, which included interfering with the travel of the protesters and the arrests of as many as 150 people who attempted to break through police lines.

on 12 september 2007, putin dissolved the government upon the request of prime minister mikhail fradkov. fradkov commented that it was to give the president a ""free hand"" in the run-up to the parliamentary election. viktor zubkov was appointed the new prime minister.

in december 2007, united russia won 64.24% of the popular vote in their run for state duma according to election preliminary results. united russia's victory in the december 2007 elections was seen by many as an indication of strong popular support of the then russian leadership and its policies.

putin was barred from a third consecutive term by the constitution. first deputy prime minister dmitry medvedev was elected his successor. in a power-switching operation on 8 may 2008, only a day after handing the presidency to medvedev, putin was appointed prime minister of russia, maintaining his political dominance.

putin has said that overcoming the consequences of the world economic crisis was one of the two main achievements of his second premiership. the other was the stabilizing the size of russia's population between 2008 and 2011 following a long period of demographic collapse that began in the 1990s.

at the united russia congress in moscow on 24 september 2011, medvedev officially proposed that putin stand for the presidency in 2012, an offer putin accepted. given united russia's near-total dominance of russian politics, many observers believed that putin was assured of a third term. the move was expected to see medvedev stand on the united russia ticket in the parliamentary elections in december, with a goal of becoming prime minister at the end of his presidential term.

after the parliamentary elections on 4 december 2011, tens of thousands of russians engaged in protests against alleged electoral fraud, the largest protests in putin's time. protesters criticized putin and united russia and demanded annulment of the election results. those protests sparked the fear of a colour revolution in society. putin allegedly organized a number of paramilitary groups loyal to himself and to the united russia party in the period between 2005 and 2012.

on 24 september 2011, while speaking at the united russia party congress, medvedev announced that he would recommend the party nominate putin as its presidential candidate. he also revealed that the two men had long ago cut a deal to allow putin to run for president in 2012. this switch was termed by many in the media as ""rokirovka"", the russian term for the chess move ""castling"". medvedev said he himself would be ready to perform ""practical work in the government"".

on 4 march 2012, putin won the 2012 russian presidential elections in the first round, with 63.6% of the vote, despite widespread accusations of vote-rigging. opposition groups accused putin and the united russia party of fraud. while efforts to make the elections transparent were publicized, including the usage of webcams in polling stations, the vote was criticized by the russian opposition and by international observers from the organization for security and co-operation in europe for procedural irregularities.

anti-putin protests took place during and directly after the presidential campaign. the most notorious protest was the pussy riot performance on 21 february, and subsequent trial. an estimated 8,000â20,000 protesters gathered in moscow on 6 may, when eighty people were injured in confrontations with police, and 450 were arrested, with another 120 arrests taking place the following day. a counter-protest of putin supporters occurred which culminated in a gathering of an estimated 130,000 supporters at the luzhniki stadium, russia's largest stadium. some of the attendees stated that they had been paid to come, were forced to come by their employers, or were misled into believing that they were going to attend a folk festival instead. the rally is considered to be the largest in support of putin to date.

putin's presidency was inaugurated in the kremlin on 7 may 2012. on his first day as president, putin issued 14 presidential decrees, which are sometimes called the ""may decrees"" by the media, including a lengthy one stating wide-ranging goals for the russian economy. other decrees concerned education, housing, skilled labor training, relations with the european union, the defense industry, inter-ethnic relations, and other policy areas dealt with in putin's program articles issued during the presidential campaign.

in 2012 and 2013, putin and the united russia party backed stricter legislation against the lgbt community, in saint petersburg, archangelsk and novosibirsk; a law called the russian gay propaganda law, that is against ""homosexual propaganda"" (which prohibits such symbols as the rainbow flag as well as published works containing homosexual content) was adopted by the state duma in june 2013. responding to international concerns about russia's legislation, putin asked critics to note that the law was a ""ban on the propaganda of pedophilia and homosexuality"" and he stated that homosexual visitors to the 2014 winter olympics should ""leave the children in peace"" but denied there was any ""professional, career or social discrimination"" against homosexuals in russia.

in june 2013, putin attended a televised rally of the all-russia people's front where he was elected head of the movement, which was set up in 2011. according to journalist steve rosenberg, the movement is intended to ""reconnect the kremlin to the russian people"" and one day, if necessary, replace the increasingly unpopular united russia party that currently backs putin.

in 2014, russia made several military incursions into ukrainian territory. after the euromaidan protests and the fall of ukrainian president viktor yanukovych, russian soldiers without insignias took control of strategic positions and infrastructure within the ukrainian territory of crimea. russia then annexed crimea after a disputed referendum in which crimeans voted to join the russian federation, according to official results. subsequently, demonstrations by pro-russian groups in the donbass area of ukraine escalated into an armed conflict between the ukrainian government and the russia-backed separatist forces of the self-declared donetsk and lugansk people's republics. in august russian military vehicles crossed the border in several locations of donetsk oblast. the incursion by the russian military was seen as responsible for the defeat of ukrainian forces in early september.
in november 2014, the ukrainian military reported intensive movement of troops and equipment from russia into the separatist-controlled parts of eastern ukraine. the associated press reported 80 unmarked military vehicles on the move in rebel-controlled areas. an osce special monitoring mission observed convoys of heavy weapons and tanks in dpr-controlled territory without insignia. osce monitors further stated that they observed vehicles transporting ammunition and soldiers' dead bodies crossing the russian-ukrainian border under the guise of humanitarian-aid convoys. as of early august 2015, the osce observed over 21 such vehicles marked with the russian military code for soldiers killed in action. according to ""the moscow times"", russia has tried to intimidate and silence human-rights workers discussing russian soldiers' deaths in the conflict. the osce repeatedly reported that its observers were denied access to the areas controlled by ""combined russian-separatist forces"".

the majority of members of the international community and organizations such as amnesty international have condemned russia for its actions in post-revolutionary ukraine, accusing it of breaking international law and of violating ukrainian sovereignty. many countries implemented economic sanctions against russia, russian individuals or companies to which russia responded in kind.

in october 2015, ""the washington post"" reported that russia had redeployed some of its elite units from ukraine to syria in recent weeks to support syrian president bashar al-assad. in december 2015, russian federation president putin admitted that russian military intelligence officers were operating in ukraine.

many members of the international community assumed that putin's annexation of crimea had initiated a completely new kind of russian foreign policy.
they took the annexation of crimea to mean that his foreign policy had shifted ""from state-driven foreign policy"" to taking an offensive stance to re-create the soviet union. however, this policy shift can be understood as putin trying to defend nations in russia's sphere of influence from encroaching western power. while the act to annex the crimea was bold and drastic, his ""new"" foreign policy may have more similarities to his older policies.

on 30 september 2015, president putin authorized russian military intervention in the syrian civil war, following a formal request by the syrian government for military help against rebel and jihadist groups.

the russian military activities consisted of air strikes, cruise missile strikes and the use of front line advisors and russian special forces against militant groups opposed to the syrian government, including the syrian opposition, as well as islamic state of iraq and the levant (isil), al-nusra front (al-qaeda in the levant), tahrir al-sham, ahrar al-sham and the army of conquest. after putin's announcement on 14 march 2016 that the mission he had set for the russian military in syria had been ""largely accomplished"" and ordered the withdrawal of the ""main part"" of the russian forces from syria, russian forces deployed in syria continued to actively operate in support of the syrian government.

in january 2017, a u.s. intelligence community assessment expressed ""high confidence"" that putin personally ordered an ""influence campaign,"" initially to denigrate hillary clinton and to harm her electoral chances and potential presidency, then later developing âa clear preference"" for donald trump. putin has consistently denied any russian interference in the u.s. election. ""the new york times"" reported in july 2018 that the cia had long nurtured a russian source who eventually rose to a position close to putin, allowing the source to pass key information in 2016 about putin's direct involvement.

putin won the 2018 presidential election with more than 76% of the vote. his fourth term began on 7 may 2018. on the same day, putin invited dmitry medvedev to form a new government. on 15 may 2018, putin took part in the opening of the movement along the highway section of the crimean bridge. on 18 may 2018, putin signed decrees on the composition of the new government. on 25 may 2018, putin announced that he would not run for president in 2024, justifying this in compliance with the russian constitution. on 14 june 2018, putin opened the 21st fifa world cup, which took place in russia for the first time.

in september 2019, putin's administration interfered with the results of russia's nationwide regional elections, and manipulated it by eliminating all candidates in the opposition. the event that was aimed at contributing to the ruling party, united russia's victory, also contributed to inciting mass protests for democracy, leading to large-scale arrests and cases of police brutality.

putin's domestic policies, particularly early in his first presidency, were aimed at creating a vertical power structure. on 13 may 2000, he issued a decree putting the 89 federal subjects of russia into seven administrative federal districts and appointed a presidential envoy responsible for each of those districts (whose official title is plenipotentiary representative).

according to stephen white, under the presidency of putin russia made it clear that it had no intention of establishing a ""second edition"" of the american or british political system, but rather a system that was closer to russia's own traditions and circumstances. some commentators have described putin's administration as a ""sovereign democracy"". according to the proponents of that description (primarily vladislav surkov), the government's actions and policies ought above all to enjoy popular support within russia itself and not be directed or influenced from outside the country. the practice of the system is however characterized by swedish economist anders ãslund:

the period after 2012 also saw mass protests against the falsification of elections, censorship and toughening of free assembly laws.

in july 2000, according to a law proposed by putin and approved by the federal assembly of russia, putin gained the right to dismiss the heads of the 89 federal subjects. in 2004, the direct election of those heads (usually called ""governors"") by popular vote was replaced with a system whereby they would be nominated by the president and approved or disapproved by regional legislatures. this was seen by putin as a necessary move to stop separatist tendencies and get rid of those governors who were connected with organised crime. this and other government actions effected under putin's presidency have been criticised by many independent russian media outlets and western commentators as anti-democratic. in 2012, as proposed by putin's successor, dmitry medvedev, the direct election of governors was re-introduced.

during his first term in office, putin opposed some of the yeltsin-era oligarchs, as well as his political opponents, resulting in the exile or imprisonment of such people as boris berezovsky, vladimir gusinsky, and mikhail khodorkovsky; other oligarchs such as roman abramovich and arkady rotenberg are friends and allies with putin.

putin succeeded in codifying land law and tax law and promulgated new codes on labor, administrative, criminal, commercial and civil procedural law. under medvedev's presidency, putin's government implemented some key reforms in the area of state security, the russian police reform and the russian military reform.

fueled by the 2000s commodities boom including record high oil prices, under the putin administration from 2001 to 2007, the economy made real gains of an average 7% per year, making it the 7th largest economy in the world in purchasing power. in 2007, russia's gdp exceeded that of russian sfsr in 1990, having recovered from the 1998 financial crisis and the preceding recession in the 1990s.

during putin's first eight years in office, industry grew substantially, as did production, construction, real incomes, credit, and the middle class. putin has also been praised for eliminating widespread barter and thus boosting the economy. inflation remained a problem however.

a fund for oil revenue allowed russia to repay all of the soviet union's debts by 2005. russia joined the world trade organization on 22 august 2012.
control over the economy was increased by placing individuals from the intelligence services and the military in key positions of the russian economy, including on boards of large companies.
in 2005, an industry consolidation programme was launched to bring the main aircraft producing companies under a single umbrella organization, the united aircraft corporation (uac). the aim was to optimize production lines and minimise losses. the uac is one of russia's ""national champions"" and comparable to eads in europe.

a program was introduced with the aim of increasing russia's share of the european energy market by building submerged gas pipelines bypassing ukraine and other countries which were often seen as non-reliable transit partners by russia, especially following the russia-ukraine gas disputes of the late 2000s. russia also undermined the rival nabucco pipeline project by buying gas from turkmenistan and redirecting it into russian pipelines.

russia diversified its export markets by building the trans-siberian oil pipeline to support oil exports to china, japan and korea, as well as the sakhalinâkhabarovskâvladivostok gas pipeline in the russian far east. russia has also recently built several major oil and gas refineries, plants and ports. major hydropower plants such as the bureya dam and the boguchany dam have been constructed, as well as the restoration of the nuclear industry of russia, with 1â trillion rubles ($42.7â billion) which were allocated from the federal budget to nuclear power and industry development before 2015. many nuclear power stations and units are currently being constructed by the state corporation rosatom in russia and abroad.
a construction program of floating nuclear power plants is intended to provide power to russian arctic coastal cities and gas rigs, starting in 2012. the arctic policy of russia also includes an offshore oilfield in the pechora sea which is expected to start producing in early 2012, with the world's first ice-resistant oil platform and first offshore arctic platform. in august 2011, rosneft, a russian government-operated oil company, signed a deal with exxonmobil for arctic oil production.

the construction of a pipeline at a cost of $77â  billion, to be jointly funded by russia and china, was signed off on by putin in shanghai on 21 may 2014. on completion, in an estimated 4 to 6 years, the pipeline would deliver natural gas from the state-majority-owned gazprom to china's state-owned china national petroleum corporation for the next 30 years, in a deal worth $400bn.

in 2014, the organized crime and corruption reporting project named putin their person of the year award for furthering corruption and organized crime.

as noted by russian journalists after the 2018 presidential inauguration, putin has since 2007 repeatedly predicted that russia will become ""one of the world's fifth largest economies"" roughly within 10 years from that date; thus far this target has not been achieved.

the ongoing financial crisis began in the second half of 2014 when the russian ruble collapsed due to a decline in the price of oil and international sanctions against russia. these events in turn led to loss of investor confidence and capital flight. though it has also been argued that the sanctions had little to no effect on russia's economy.

energy, trade, and finance agreements with china worth $25 billion were signed in october 2014 in an effort to compensate for international sanctions. the following year, a $400 billion 30-year natural gas supply agreement was also signed with china.

in 2004, president putin signed the kyoto protocol treaty designed to reduce greenhouse gases. however, russia did not face mandatory cuts, because the kyoto protocol limits emissions to a percentage increase or decrease from 1990 levels and russia's greenhouse-gas emissions fell well below the 1990 baseline due to a drop in economic output after the breakup of the soviet union.

putin personally supervises a number of protection programmes for rare and endangered animals in russia, such as the amur tiger, the white whale, the polar bear and the snow leopard.

buddhism, eastern orthodox christianity, islam and judaism, defined by law as russia's traditional religions and a part of russia's historical heritage, enjoyed limited state support in the putin era. the vast construction and restoration of churches, started in the 1990s, continued under putin, and the state allowed the teaching of religion in schools (parents are provided with a choice for their children to learn the basics of one of the traditional religions or secular ethics). his approach to religious policy has been characterized as one of support for religious freedoms, but also the attempt to unify different religions under the authority of the state. in 2012, putin was honored in bethlehem and a street was named after him.
putin regularly attends the most important services of the russian orthodox church on the main orthodox christian holidays. he established a good relationship with patriarchs of the russian church, the late alexy ii of moscow and the current kirill of moscow. as president, he took an active personal part in promoting the act of canonical communion with the moscow patriarchate, signed 17 may 2007 that restored relations between the moscow-based russian orthodox church and the russian orthodox church outside russia after the 80-year schism.

under putin, the hasidic fjcr became increasingly influential within the jewish community, partly due to the influence of federation-supporting businessmen mediated through their alliances with putin, notably lev leviev and roman abramovich. according to the jta, putin is popular amongst the russian jewish community, who see him as a force for stability. russia's chief rabbi, berel lazar, said putin ""paid great attention to the needs of our community and related to us with a deep respect"". in 2016, ronald s. lauder, the president of the world jewish congress, also praised putin for making russia ""a country where jews are welcome"".

the resumption of long-distance flights of russia's strategic bombers was followed by the announcement by russian defense minister anatoliy serdyukov during his meeting with putin on 5 december 2007, that 11 ships, including the aircraft carrier ""kuznetsov"", would take part in the first major navy sortie into the mediterranean since soviet times. the sortie was to be backed up by 47â aircraft, including strategic bombers.

while from the early 2000s russia started placing more money into its military and defense industry, it was only in 2008 that the full-scale russian military reform began, aiming to modernize the russian armed forces and making them significantly more effective. the reform was largely carried out by defense minister anatoly serdyukov during medvedev's presidency, under the supervision of both putin, as the head of government, and medvedev, as the commander-in-chief of the russian armed forces.

key elements of the reform included reducing the armed forces to a strength of one million; reducing the number of officers; centralising officer training from 65 military schools into 10 'systemic' military training centres; creating a professional nco corps; reducing the size of the central command; introducing more civilian logistics and auxiliary staff; elimination of cadre-strength formations; reorganising the reserves; reorganising the army into a brigade system, and reorganising air forces into an air base system instead of regiments.

the number of russia's military districts was reduced to four. the term of draft service was reduced from two years to one, which put an end to the old harassment traditions in russian army, since all conscripts became very close by draft age. the gradual transition to the majority professional army by the late 2010s was announced, and a large programme of supplying the armed forces with new military equipment and ships was started. the russian space forces were replaced on 1 december 2011 with the russian aerospace defence forces.

in spite of putin's call for major investments in strategic nuclear weapons, these will fall well below the new start limits due to the retirement of aging systems. after u.s. president george w. bush withdrew from the 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty, putin responded by ordering a build-up of russia's nuclear capabilities, designed to counterbalance u.s. capabilities. most analysts agree that russia's nuclear strategy under putin eventually brought it into violation of the 1987 intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty. because of this, u.s. president donald trump announced the u.s. would no longer consider itself bound by the treaty's provisions, raising nuclear tensions between the two powers. this prompted putin to state that russia would not launch first in a nuclear conflict but would âannihilateâ any adversary. russians killed in such a conflict âwill go to heaven as martyrsâ. most military analysts believe russia would consider launching first if losing a major conventional conflict as part of an 'escalate to de-escalateâ strategy that would bring adversaries to the negotiating table.

putin has also sought to increase russian territorial claims in the arctic and its military presence here. in august 2007, russian expedition arktika 2007, part of research related to the 2001 russian territorial extension claim, planted a flag on the seabed below the north pole. both russian submarines and troops deployed in the arctic have been increasing.

an ngo based in the new york city; human rights watch; in a report entitled ""laws of attrition"", authored by hugh williamson, the british director of hrw's europe & central asia division, has claimed that since may 2012, when putin was re-elected as president, russia has enacted many restrictive laws, started inspections of nongovernmental organizations, harassed, intimidated, and imprisoned political activists, and started to restrict critics. the new laws include the ""foreign agents"" law, which is widely regarded as over-broad by including russian human rights organizations which receive some international grant funding, the treason law, and the assembly law which penalizes many expressions of dissent. human rights activists have criticized russia for censoring speech of lgbt activists due to ""the gay propaganda law"" and increasing violence against lgbt+ people due to the law.

scott gehlbach, an american professor of political science at the university of wisconsinâmadison, has claimed that since 1999, putin has reportedly punished journalists who challenge his official point of view. maria lipman, an american writing in ""foreign affairs"" (the journal of the council on foreign relations), claims, ""the crackdown that followed putin's return to the kremlin in 2012 extended to the liberal media, which had until then been allowed to operate fairly independently."" the internet has attracted putin's attention because his critics have tried to use it to challenge his control of information. marian k. leighton, who worked for the cia as a soviet analyst in the 1980s says, ""having muzzled russia's print and broadcast media, putin focused his energies on the internet."" robert w. orttung and christopher walker report:

in the early 2000s, putin and others in his government began promoting the idea in russian media that they are the modern-day version of the 17th-century romanov tsars who ended russia's ""time of troubles"", meaning they claim to be the peacemakers and stabilizers after the fall of the soviet union.

putin has promoted explicitly conservative policies in social, cultural and political matters, both at home and abroad. putin has attacked globalism and neo-liberalism and is identified by scholars with russian conservatism. putin has promoted new think tanks that bring together like-minded intellectuals and writers. for example, the izborsky club, founded in 2012 by the conservative right-wing journalist alexander prokhanov, stresses (i) russian nationalism, (ii) the restoration of russia's historical greatness, and (iii) systematic opposition to liberal ideas and policies. vladislav surkov, a senior government official, has been one of the key economics consultants during putin's presidency.

in cultural and social affairs putin has collaborated closely with the russian orthodox church. patriarch kirill of moscow, head of the church, endorsed his election in 2012 stating putin's terms were like ""a miracle of god."" steven myers reports, ""the church, once heavily repressed, had emerged from the soviet collapse as one of the most respected institutions... now kiril led the faithful directly into an alliance with the state.""

mark woods, a baptist minister and contributing editor to ""christian today"", provides specific examples of how the church has backed the expansion of russian power into crimea and eastern ukraine. more broadly, ""the new york times"" reports in september 2016 how the church's policy prescriptions support the kremlin's appeal to social conservatives:

in 2007, putin led a successful effort on behalf of sochi (located along the black sea near the border between georgia and russia) for the 2014 winter olympics and the 2014 winter paralympics, the first winter olympic games to ever be hosted by russia. likewise, in 2008, the city of kazan won the bid for the 2013 summer universiade, and on 2 december 2010 russia won the right to host the 2017 fifa confederations cup and 2018 fifa world cup, also for the first time in russian history. in 2013, putin stated that gay athletes would not face any discrimination at the 2014 sochi winter olympics.

putin is chairman of the russian geographical society's board of trustees and is actively engaged in the protection of rare species. the programs are being conducted by the severtsov institute of ecology and evolution at the russian academy of sciences.

in 2012, putin wrote an article in the hindu newspaper, saying that ""the declaration on strategic partnership between india and russia signed in october 2000 became a truly historic step"". prime minister manmohan singh during putin's 2012 visit to india: ""president putin is a valued friend of india and the original architect of the india-russia strategic partnership"".

putin's russia maintains positive relations with other bric countries. the country has sought to strengthen ties especially with the people's republic of china by signing the treaty of friendship as well as building the trans-siberian oil pipeline geared toward growing chinese energy needs. the mutual-security cooperation of the two countries and their central asian neighbours is facilitated by the shanghai cooperation organisation (sco) which was founded in 2001 in shanghai by the leaders of china, kazakhstan, kyrgyzstan, russia, tajikistan, and uzbekistan.

the announcement made during the sco summit that russia resumes on a permanent basis the long-distance patrol flights of its strategic bombers (suspended in 1992) in the light of joint russian-chinese military exercises, first-ever in history held on russian territory, made some experts believe that putin is inclined to set up an anti-nato bloc or the asian version of opec. when presented with the suggestion that ""western observers are already likening the sco to a military organization that would stand in opposition to nato"", putin answered that ""this kind of comparison is inappropriate in both form and substance"".

a series of so-called colour revolutions in the post-soviet states, namely the rose revolution in georgia in 2003, the orange revolution in ukraine in 2004 and the tulip revolution in kyrgyzstan in 2005, led to frictions in the relations of those countries with russia. in december 2004, putin criticized the rose and orange revolutions, saying: ""if you have permanent revolutions you risk plunging the post-soviet space into endless conflict"".
a number of economic disputes erupted between russia and some neighbors, such as the russian import ban of georgian wine. and in some cases, such as the russiaâukraine gas disputes, the economic conflicts affected other european countries, for example when a january 2009 gas dispute with ukraine led state-controlled russian company gazprom to halt its deliveries of natural gas to ukraine, which left a number of european states, to which ukraine transits russian gas, with serious shortages of natural gas in january 2009.

the plans of georgia and ukraine to become members of nato have caused some tensions between russia and those states. in 2010, ukraine did abandon these plans. putin allegedly declared at a nato-russia summit in 2008 that if ukraine joined nato russia could contend to annex the ukrainian east and crimea. at the summit, he told us president george w. bush that ""ukraine is not even a state!"" while the following year putin referred to ukraine as ""little russia"". following the 2014 ukrainian revolution in march 2014, the russian federation annexed crimea. according to putin, this was done because ""crimea has always been and remains an inseparable part of russia"". after the russian annexion of crimea, he said that ukraine includes ""regions of russia's historic south"" and ""was created on a whim by the bolsheviks"". he went on to declare that the february 2014 ousting of ukrainian president viktor yanukovych had been orchestrated by the west as an attempt to weaken russia. ""our western partners have crossed a line. they behaved rudely, irresponsibly and unprofessionally,"" he said, adding that the people who had come to power in ukraine were ""nationalists, neo-nazis, russophobes and anti-semites"". in a july 2014 speech midst an armed insurgency in eastern ukraine, putin stated he would use russia's ""entire arsenal"" and ""the right of self defence"" to protect russian speakers outside russia. with the split of the ukrainian orthodox church from the russian one in 2018, a number of experts came to the conclusion that putin's policy of forceful engagement in post-soviet republics significantly backfired on him, leading to a situation where he ""annexed crimea, but lost ukraine"", and provoked a much more cautious approach to russia among other post-soviet countries.
in late august 2014, putin stated: ""people who have their own views on history and the history of our country may argue with me, but it seems to me that the russian and ukrainian peoples are practically one people"". after making a similar statement, in late december 2015 he stated: ""the ukrainian culture, as well as ukrainian literature, surely has a source of its own"".
in august 2008, georgian president mikheil saakashvili attempted to restore control over the breakaway south ossetia. however, the georgian military was soon defeated in the resulting 2008 south ossetia war after regular russian forces entered south ossetia and then georgia proper, then also opened a second front in the other georgian breakaway province of abkhazia with abkhazian forces.

despite existing or past tensions between russia and most of the post-soviet states, putin has followed the policy of eurasian integration. putin endorsed the idea of a eurasian union in 2011; the concept was proposed by the president of kazakhstan in 1994. on 18 november 2011, the presidents of belarus, kazakhstan and russia signed an agreement setting a target of establishing the eurasian union by 2015. the eurasian union was established on 1 january 2015.

under putin, russia's relationships with nato and the u.s. have passed through several stages. when he first became president, relations were cautious, but after the 9/11 attacks putin quickly supported the u.s. in the war on terror and the opportunity for partnership appeared. however, the u.s. responded by further expansion of nato to russia's borders and by unilateral withdrawal from the 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty.

from 2003, when russia did not support the iraq war and when putin became ever more distant from the west in his internal and external policies, relations continued to deteriorate. according to russia scholar stephen f. cohen, the narrative of the mainstream u.s. media, following that of the white house, became anti-putin. in an interview with michael stã¼rmer, putin said there were three questions which most concerned russia and eastern europe: namely, the status of kosovo, the treaty on conventional armed forces in europe and american plans to build missile defence sites in poland and the czech republic, and suggested that all three were linked. his view was that concessions by the west on one of the questions might be met with concessions from russia on another.

in a january 2007 interview, putin said russia was in favor of a democratic multipolar world and strengthening the systems of international law.

in february 2007, putin criticized what he called the united states' monopolistic dominance in global relations, and ""almost uncontained hyper use of force in international relations"". he said the result of it is that ""no one feels safe! because no one can feel that international law is like a stone wall that will protect them. of course such a policy stimulates an arms race"". this came to be known as the munich speech, and former nato secretary jaap de hoop scheffer called the speech ""disappointing and not helpful."" the months following putin's munich speech were marked by tension and a surge in rhetoric on both sides of the atlantic. both russian and american officials, however, denied the idea of a new cold war.
putin publicly opposed plans for the u.s. missile shield in europe and presented president george w. bush with a counterproposal on 7 june 2007 which was declined. russia suspended its participation in the conventional forces in europe treaty on 11 december 2007.

putin opposed kosovo's 2008 declaration of independence, warning supporters of that precedent that it would ""de facto"" destabilize the whole system of international relations.
putin had good relations with former american president george w. bush, and many european leaders. his ""cooler"" and ""more business-like"" relationship with germany's current chancellor, angela merkel is often attributed to merkel's upbringing in the former ddr, where putin was stationed as a kgb agent. he had a very friendly and warm relationship with the former prime minister of italy silvio berlusconi; the two leaders often described their relationship as a close friendship, continuing to organize bilateral meetings even after berlusconi's resignation in november 2011.

in late 2013, russian-american relations deteriorated further when the united states canceled a summit (for the first time since 1960) after putin gave asylum to edward snowden, who had leaked classified information from the nsa.

relations were further strained after the 2014â15 russian military intervention in ukraine and the annexation of crimea.

in 2014, russia was suspended from the g8 group as a result of its annexation of crimea. however, in june 2015, putin told an italian newspaper that russia has no intention of attacking nato.
on 9 november 2016, putin congratulated donald trump on becoming the 45th president of the united states.

in december 2016, us intelligence officials (headed by james clapper) quoted by cbs news stated that putin approved the email hacking and cyber attacks during the u.s. election, against the democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton. a spokesman for putin denied the reports. putin has repeatedly accused hillary clinton, who served as u.s. secretary of state from 2009 to 2013, of interfering in russia's internal affairs, and in december 2016, clinton accused putin of having a personal grudge against her.
with the election of trump, putin's favorability in the u.s. increased. a gallup poll in february 2017 revealed a positive view of putin among 22% of americans, the highest since 2003. however, putin has stated that u.s.ârussian relations, already at the lowest level since the end of the cold war, have continued to deteriorate after trump took office in january 2017.

in 2003, relations between russia and the united kingdom deteriorated when the united kingdom granted political asylum to putin's former patron, oligarch boris berezovsky. this deterioration was intensified by allegations that the british were spying and making secret payments to pro-democracy and human rights groups.

the end of 2006 brought more strained relations in the wake of the death by polonium poisoning of former kgb and fsb officer alexander litvinenko in london, who became an mi6 agent in 2003. in 2007, the crisis in relations continued with expulsion of four russian envoys over russia's refusal to extradite former kgb bodyguard andrei lugovoi to face charges in the murder of litvinenko. mirroring the british actions, russia expelled uk diplomats and took other retaliatory steps.

in 2015â16, the british government conducted an inquiry into the death of alexander litvinenko. its report was released in january 2016. according to the report, ""the fsb operation to kill mr litvinenko was probably approved by mr patrushev and also by president putin."" the report outlined some possible motives for the murder, including litvinenko's public statements and books about the alleged involvement of the fsb in mass murder, and what was ""undoubtedly a personal dimension to the antagonism"" between putin and litvinenko, led to the murder. media analyst william dunkerley, writing in ""the guardian"", criticised the inquiry as politically motivated, biased, lacking in evidence, and logically inconsistent. the kremlin dismissed the inquiry as ""a joke"" and ""whitewash"".

poisoning of sergei skripal

on 4 march 2018, former double agent sergei skripal was poisoned with a novichok nerve agent in salisbury. 10 days later, the british government formally accused the russian state of attempted murder, a charge which russia denied. after the uk expelled 23 russian diplomats (an action which would later be responded to with a russian expulsion of 23 british diplomats), british foreign secretary boris johnson said on 16 march that it was ""overwhelmingly likely"" putin had personally ordered the poisoning of skripal. putin's spokesman dmitry peskov called the allegation ""shocking and unpardonable diplomatic misconduct"".

putin and his successor, medvedev, enjoyed warm relations with the late hugo chã¡vez of venezuela. much of this has been through the sale of military equipment; since 2005, venezuela has purchased more than $4â billion worth of arms from russia. in september 2008, russia sent tupolev tu-160 bombers to venezuela to carry out training flights. in november 2008, both countries held a joint naval exercise in the caribbean. earlier in 2000, putin had re-established stronger ties with fidel castro's cuba.

in september 2007, putin visited indonesia and in doing so became the first russian leader to visit the country in more than 50 years. in the same month, putin also attended the apec meeting held in sydney where he met with john howard, who was the australian prime minister at the time, and signed a uranium trade deal for australia to sell uranium to russia. this was the first visit by a russian president to australia.

on 16 october 2007, putin visited iran to participate in the second caspian summit in tehran, where he met with iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad. this was the first visit of a soviet or russian leader to iran since joseph stalin's participation in the tehran conference in 1943, and thus marked a significant event in iran-russia relations. at a press conference after the summit putin said that ""all our (caspian) states have the right to develop their peaceful nuclear programmes without any restrictions"".
subsequently, under medvedev's presidency, iran-russia relations were uneven: russia did not fulfill the contract of selling to iran the s-300, one of the most potent anti-aircraft missile systems currently existing. however, russian specialists completed the construction of iran and the middle east's first civilian nuclear power facility, the bushehr nuclear power plant, and russia has continuously opposed the imposition of economic sanctions on iran by the u.s. and the eu, as well as warning against a military attack on iran. putin was quoted as describing iran as a ""partner"", though he expressed concerns over the iranian nuclear programme.

in april 2008, putin became the first russian president who visited libya. putin condemned the foreign military intervention of libya, he called un resolution as ""defective and flawed,"" and added ""it allows everything. it resembles medieval calls for crusades."" upon the death of muammar gaddafi, putin called it as ""planned murder"" by the us, saying: ""they showed to the whole world how he (gaddafi) was killed,"" and ""there was blood all over. is that what they call a democracy?""
regarding syria, from 2000 to 2010 russia sold around $1.5â billion worth of arms to that country, making damascus moscow's seventh-largest client.
during the syrian civil war, russia threatened to veto any sanctions against the syrian government, and continued to supply arms to the regime.

putin opposed any foreign intervention. in june 2012, in paris, he rejected the statement of french president franã§ois hollande who called on bashar al-assad to step down. putin echoed assad's argument that anti-regime ""militants"" were responsible for much of the bloodshed. he also talked about previous nato interventions and their results, and asked ""what is happening in libya, in iraq? did they become safer? where are they heading? nobody has an answer"".

on 11 september 2013, ""the new york times"" published an op-ed by putin urging caution against us intervention in syria and criticizing american exceptionalism. putin subsequently helped to arrange for the destruction of syria's chemical weapons. in 2015, he took a stronger pro-assad stance and mobilized military support for the regime. some analysts have summarized putin as being allied with shiites and alawites in the middle east.

in october 2019, russian president vladimir putin visited the united arab emirates, where six agreements were struck with abu dhabi crown prince mohammed bin zayed. one of them included shared investments between russian sovereign wealth fund and the emirati investment fund mubadala. the two nations signed deals worth over $1.3bn, in energy, health and advance technology sectors.

president putin has attended the brics (brazil, russia, india, china and south africa) summit conferences since 2013.

many well known politicians and people from other categories have compared vladimir putin to nazi german fã¼hrer adolf hitler. it is often related to the activity against ukraine and the violation of international law. among them are prince charles, hillary clinton, wolfgang schaeuble, mikheil saakashvili, vladislav inozemtsev, zbigniew brzezinski, john mccain, marco rubio, lindsey graham, stephen harper, garry kasparov, charles lane, david cameron, boris johnson, dalia grybauskaite, bronisåaw komorowski, arkady babchenko, savik shuster, stephen fry, ian austin, andrey piontkovsky, boris nemtsov, nikolay fyodorov, carl bildt, petro poroshenko, and herta mã¼ller. the crimean speech of the russian president played a role for some comparisons on the ukrainian issue.

according to a june 2007 public opinion survey, putin's approval rating was 81%, the second highest of any leader in the world that year. in january 2013, at the time of 2011â2013 russian protests, putin's approval rating fell to 62%, the lowest figure since 2000 and a ten-point drop over two years. by may 2014, following the annexation of crimea, putin's approval rating had rebounded to 85.9%, a six-year high.

after eu and u.s. sanctions against russian officials as a result of the 2014 pro-russian unrest in ukraine, putin's approval rating reached 87 percent, according to a levada center survey published on 6 august 2014. in february 2015, based on new domestic polling, putin was ranked the world's most popular politician. in june 2015, putin's approval rating climbed to 89%, an all-time high. in 2016, the approval rating was 81%.

observers see putin's high approval ratings as a consequence of significant improvements in living standards, and russia's reassertion of itself on the world scene during his presidency.

despite high approval for putin, confidence in the russian economy is low, dropping to levels in 2016 that rivaled the recent lows in 2009 at the height of the global economic crisis. just 14% of russians in 2016 said their national economy was getting better, and 18% said this about their local economies. putin's performance at reining in corruption is also unpopular among russians. ""newsweek"" reported in june 2017 that ""an opinion poll by the moscow-based levada center indicated that 67 percent held putin personally responsible for high-level corruption"".

in july 2018, putin's approval rating fell to 63% and just 49% would vote for putin if presidential elections were held. levada poll results published in september 2018 showed putin's personal trustworthiness levels at 39% (decline from 59% in november 2017) with the main contributing factor being the presidential support of the unpopular pension reform and economic stagnation. in october 2018, two thirds of russians surveyed in levada poll agreed that ""putin bears full responsibility for the problems of the country"" which has been attributed to decline of a popular belief in ""good tsar and bad boyars"", a traditional attitude towards justifying failures of top of ruling hierarchy in russia.

in january 2019, the percentage of russians trusting the president hit a then-historic minimum â 33.4%. it declined further to 31.7% in may 2019 which led to a dispute between the vciom and president's administration office, who accused it of incorrectly using an open question, after which vciom repeated the poll with a closed question getting 72.3%. nonetheless, in april 2019 gallup poll showed a record number of russians (20%) willing to permanently emigrate from russia. the decline is even larger in the 17-25 age group, ""who find themselves largely disconnected from the countryâs aging leadership, nostalgic soviet rhetoric and nepotistic agenda"", according to a report prepared by vladimir milov. the percentage of people willing to emigrate permanently in this age group is 41% and 60% has favorable views on the united states (three times more than in the 55+ age group). decline in support for president and the government is also visible in other polls, such as rapidly growing readiness to protest against poor living conditions.

critics state that putin has moved russia in an autocratic direction. putin has been described as a ""dictator"" by political opponent garry kasparov, as a ""bully"" and ""arrogant"" by former u.s. secretary of state hillary clinton, and as ""self-centered"" and an ""isolationist"" by the dalai lama. former u.s. secretary of state henry kissinger wrote in 2014 that the west has demonized putin.

many russians credit putin for reviving russia's fortunes. former soviet union leader mikhail gorbachev, while acknowledging the flawed democratic procedures and restrictions on media freedom during the putin presidency, said that putin had pulled russia out of chaos at the end of the yeltsin years, and that russians ""must remember that putin saved russia from the beginning of a collapse."" in 2015, opposition politician boris nemtsov said that putin was turning russia into a ""raw materials colony"" of china. chechen republic head and putin supporter, ramzan kadyrov, states that putin saved both the chechen people and russia.

russia has suffered democratic backsliding during putin's tenure. freedom house has listed russia as being ""not free"" since 2005. in 2004, freedom house warned that russia's ""retreat from freedom marks a low point not registered since 1989, when the country was part of the soviet union."" the economist intelligence unit has rated russia as ""authoritarian"" since 2011, whereas it had previously been considered a ""hybrid regime"" (with ""some form of democratic government"" in place) as late as 2007. according to political scientist, larry diamond, writing in 2015, ""no serious scholar would consider russia today a democracy"".

putin cultivates an outdoor, sporty, tough guy public image, demonstrating his physical prowess and taking part in unusual or dangerous acts, such as extreme sports and interaction with wild animals, part of a public relations approach that, according to ""wired"", ""deliberately cultivates the macho, take-charge superhero image"". for example, in 2007, the tabloid ""komsomolskaya pravda"" published a huge photograph of a bare-chested putin vacationing in the siberian mountains under the headline: ""be like putin."" some of the activities have been criticised for being staged. outside of russia, putin's macho image has been the subject of parody. putin is believed to be self conscious about his height which has been estimated by kremlin insiders at between 155â cm (5â ft 2 in) and 165â cm (5â ft 5 in) tall, but is usually given at 170â cm (5â ft 7 in).

notable examples of putin's adventures include: flying military jets, demonstrating martial arts, riding horses, rafting, and fishing and swimming in a cold siberian river, many of which he did bare chested. other examples are descending in a deepwater submersible, tranquilizing tigers and polar bears, riding a motorbike, co-piloting a firefighting plane to dump water on a raging fire, shooting darts at whales from a crossbow for eco-tracking, driving a race car, scuba diving at an archaeological site, attempting to lead endangered cranes in a motorized hang glider, and catching large fish.

there are many songs about putin. some of the well-known include: ""go hard like vladimir putin"" by k. king and beni maniaci, ""vvp"" by tajik singer tolibjon kurbankhanov, ""our madhouse is voting for putin"" by working faculty and ""a song about putin"" by the russian airborne troops band. there is also ""putin khuilo!"", the song, originally emerged as chants by ukrainian football fans and spread in ukraine (among supporters of euromaidan), then in other countries. a song called ""a man like putin"" by poyushchie vmeste was also a hit across russia, topping the russian music charts in 2002.

putin's name and image are widely used in advertisement and product branding. among the putin-branded products are putinka vodka, the putin brand of canned food, the ""gorbusha putina"" caviar and a collection of t-shirts with his image.

in 2015, his advisor was found dead after days of excessive consumption of alcohol, though this was later ruled an accident.

in 2007, he was the ""time"" person of the year. in 2015, he was no. 1 on the ""time's"" most influential people list. ""forbes"" ranked him the world's most powerful individual every year from 2013 to 2016.

putin has produced many aphorisms and catch-phrases known as putinisms. many of them were first made during his annual q&a conferences, where putin answered questions from journalists and other people in the studio, as well as from russians throughout the country, who either phoned in or spoke from studios and outdoor sites across russia. putin is known for his often tough and sharp language, often alluding to russian jokes and folk sayings.

putin sometimes uses russian criminal jargon (fenya), not always correctly.

on 28 july 1983, putin married lyudmila shkrebneva, and they lived together in east germany from 1985 to 1990. they have two daughters, mariya putina, born 28 april 1985 in leningrad, and yekaterina putina, born 31 august 1986 in dresden, east germany.

on 6 june 2013, putin announced that their marriage was over, and, on 1 april 2014, the kremlin confirmed that the divorce had been finalized.

his cousin, igor putin, was a director at moscow based master bank and was accused in a number of money laundering scandals.

official figures released during the legislative election of 2007 put putin's wealth at approximately 3.7â million rubles (us$150,000) in bank accounts, a private apartment in saint petersburg, and miscellaneous other assets. putin's reported 2006 income totaled 2 million rubles (approximately $80,000). in 2012, putin reported an income of 3.6â million rubles ($113,000).

putin has been photographed wearing a number of expensive wristwatches, collectively valued at $700,000, nearly six times his annual salary. putin has been known on occasion to give watches valued at thousands of dollars as gifts to peasants and factory workers.

according to russian opposition politicians and journalists, putin secretly possesses a multi-billion dollar fortune via successive ownership of stakes in a number of russian companies. according to one editorial in ""the washington post"", ""putin might not technically own these 43 aircraft, but, as the sole political power in russia, he can act like they're his"". russian ria journalist argued that ""[western] intelligence agencies (...) could not find anything"". these contradictory claims were analyzed by polygraph.info which looked at a number of reports by western (anders ãslund estimate of $100â160 billion) and russian (stanislav belkovsky estimated of $40 billion) analysts, cia (estimate of $40 billion in 2007) as well as counterarguments of russian media. polygraph concluded:

in april 2016, 11 million documents belonging to panamanian law firm mossack fonseca were leaked to the german newspaper ""sã¼ddeutsche zeitung"" and the washington-based international consortium of investigative journalists. the name of vladimir putin does not appear in any of the records, and putin denied his involvement with the company. however, various media have reported on three of putin's associates on the list. according to the panama papers leak, close trustees of putin own offshore companies worth us$2â billion in total. the german newspaper ""sã¼ddeutsche zeitung"" regards the possibility of putin's family profiting from this money as plausible.

according to the paper, the us$2 billion had been ""secretly shuffled through banks and shadow companies linked to putin's associates"", and bank rossiya, previously identified by the u.s. state department as being treated by putin as his personal bank account, had been central in facilitating this. it concludes that ""putin has shown he is willing to take aggressive steps to maintain secrecy and protect [such] communal assets."" a significant proportion of the money trail leads to putin's best friend sergei roldugin. although a musician, and in his own words, not a businessman, it appears he has accumulated assets valued at $100m, and possibly more. it has been suggested he was picked for the role because of his low profile. there have been speculations that putin, in fact, owns the funds, and roldugin just acted as a proxy. putin himself denied it, and his press-secretary, dmitry peskov, said the leak was a conspiracy aimed at putin.

as president and prime-minister, putin has lived in numerous official residences throughout the country. these residences include: the moscow kremlin, novo-ogaryovo in moscow oblast, the white house in moscow, near moscow, bocharov ruchey in sochi, in novgorod oblast, and riviera in sochi.

in august 2012, critics of president vladimir putin listed the ownership of 20 villas and palaces, nine of which were built during putin's 12 years in power.

soon after putin returned from his kgb service in dresden, east germany, he built a dacha in solovyovka on the eastern shore of lake komsomolskoye on the karelian isthmus in priozersky district of leningrad oblast, near st. petersburg. after the dacha burned down in 1996, putin built a new one identical to the original and was joined by a group of seven friends who built dachas nearby. in 1996, the group formally registered their fraternity as a co-operative society, calling it ozero (""lake"") and turning it into a gated community.

a massive italianate-style mansion costing an alleged us$1â billion and dubbed ""putin's palace"" is under construction near the black sea village of praskoveevka. the mansion, built on government land and sporting 3 helipads, and a private road paid for from state funds and guarded by officials wearing uniforms of the official kremlin guard service, is said to have been built for putin's private use. in 2012, sergei kolesnikov, a former business associate of putin's, told the bbc's ""newsnight"" programme that he had been ordered by deputy prime minister igor sechin to oversee the building of the palace. putin's spokesman dmitry peskov dismissed kolesnikov's allegations against putin as untrue, saying that ""putin has never had any relationship to this palace.""

putin's female black labrador retriever konni was often seen at the president's side, and was sometimes allowed to attend meetings when putin greeted world leaders during their visits to russia.

putin has four dogs, buffy, yume, verni and pasha. buffy, a karakachan dog, was given to president putin in november 2010 by the bulgarian prime minister, boyko borisov. yume is an akita inu dog which arrived in moscow in july 2012 as a three-month-old puppy as the akita prefecture's gift to show gratitude for russia's assistance to japan after the devastating earthquake and tsunami in 2011.
verni, which is an alabai â a turkmen-bred variety of the central asia shepherd dog â was a birthday gift from the leader of turkmenistan during a meeting in sochi in october 2017. putin received pasha, a å arplaninac puppy as a gift from serbia during his state visit in january 2019.

putin is russian orthodox. his mother was a devoted christian believer who attended the russian orthodox church, while his father was an atheist. though his mother kept no icons at home, she attended church regularly, despite government persecution of her religion at that time. his mother secretly baptized him as a baby, and she regularly took him to services.

according to putin, his religious awakening began after a serious car crash involving his wife in 1993, and a life-threatening fire that burned down their dacha in august 1996. shortly before an official visit to israel, putin's mother gave him his baptismal cross, telling him to get it blessed. putin states, ""i did as she said and then put the cross around my neck. i have never taken it off since."" when asked in 2007 whether he believes in god, he responded, ""... there are things i believe, which should not in my position, at least, be shared with the public at large for everybody's consumption because that would look like self-advertising or a political striptease."" putin's rumoured confessor is russian orthodox bishop tikhon shevkunov.

putin is frequently seen promoting sports and a healthy way of life among russians, including promoting skiing, badminton, cycling, and fishing.

putin watches football, and supports fc zenit saint petersburg, from his home city. he also has displayed an interest in ice hockey and bandy, the latter which in russia often is called 'russian hockey'.

putin began training in sambo at the age of 14, before switching to judo, which he continues to practice. putin won competitions in both sports in leningrad (now saint petersburg). putin was awarded 8th dan of the black belt in 2012 and became the first russian to have been awarded the eighth dan, joining a handful of judo fighters in the world who have achieved such status. putin also practises karate.

putin co-authored a book on his favorite sport, published in russian as ""judo with vladimir putin"", and in english under the title ""judo: history, theory, practice (2004)."" benjamin wittes, a black belt in taekwondo and aikido and editor of lawfare, has disputed putin's martial arts skills, saying that there is no video evidence of putin displaying any actual noteworthy judo skills.

despite an injury-prone career, sharapova has achieved a rare level of longevity in the women's game. she won at least one singles title a year from 2003 until 2015, a streak only bested by steffi graf, martina navratilova, and chris evert. several tennis pundits and former players have called sharapova one of tennis's best competitors, with john mcenroe calling her one of the best the sport has ever seen.

sharapova has been featured in a number of modeling assignments, including a feature in the ""sports illustrated swimsuit issue"". she has appeared in many advertisements, including those for nike, prince, and canon, and has been the face of several fashion houses, most notably cole haan. since february 2007, she has been a united nations development programme goodwill ambassador, concerned specifically with the chernobyl recovery and development programme. in june 2011, she was named one of the ""30 legends of women's tennis: past, present and future"" by ""time"" and in march 2012 was named one of the ""100 greatest of all time"" by tennis channel. according to forbes, she has been named highest-paid female athlete in the world for 11 consecutive years and earned 285 million (including prize money) since she turned pro in 2001.

maria sharapova was born on april 19, 1987, in nyagan, siberia, russia. her parents, yuri and yelena, are from gomel, belarussia. concerned about the regional effects of the 1986 chernobyl nuclear accident, they left their homeland shortly before maria was born.

in 1989, when sharapova was two, the family moved to sochi, krasnodar krai, russia. she hit her first tennis ball when she was 4 years old. her father, yuri, befriended aleksandr kafelnikov, whose son yevgeny would go on to win two grand slam singles titles and become russia's first world no. 1 ranked tennis player. aleksandr gave sharapova her first tennis racquet in 1991 when she was four, whereupon she began practicing regularly with her father at a local park. maria took her first tennis lessons with veteran russian coach yuri yutkin, who was instantly impressed when he saw her play, noting her ""exceptional hand-eye coordination"".

in 1993, at the age of six, sharapova attended a tennis clinic in moscow run by martina navratilova, who recommended professional training at the img academy in bradenton, florida, which had previously trained players such as andre agassi, monica seles, and anna kournikova. with money tight, yuri sharapov borrowed the sum that would enable him and his daughter, neither of whom could speak english, to travel to the united states of america, which they finally did in 1994. visa restrictions prevented sharapova's mother from joining them for two years. arriving in florida with savings of us$700, sharapova's father took various low-paying jobs, to fund her lessons until she was old enough to be admitted to the academy. before she entered the img business, she trained with rick macci, in the rick macci tennis academy. she then was offered a deal from img which forced her to change academies. originally, she did train with rick macci, but after the deal with img, she could not see rick macci anymore. in 1995, she was signed by img, who agreed to pay the annual tuition fee of $35,000 for sharapova to stay at the academy, allowing her to finally enroll at the age of 9.

sharapova first hit the tennis scene in november 2000, when she won the eddie herr international junior tennis championships in the girls' 16 division at the age of just 13. she was then given a special distinction, the rising star award, which is awarded only to players of exceptional promise. sharapova made her professional debut in 2001 on her 14th birthday on april 19, and played her first wta tournament at the pacific life open in 2002, winning a match before losing to monica seles. due to restrictions on how many professional events she could play, sharapova went to hone her game in junior tournaments, where she reached the finals of the girls' singles events at the australian open and wimbledon in 2002. she was the youngest girl ever to reach the final of the australian open junior championship at 14 years and 9 months.

sharapova had far fewer points to defend, and so she became the first russian woman to hold the world no. 1 ranking on august 22, 2005. her reign lasted only one week, however, as davenport reclaimed the top ranking after winning the pilot pen tennis tournament.

as the top seed at the us open, sharapova lost in the semifinals to kim clijsters, meaning she had lost to the eventual champion in every grand slam of the season. however, she once again leapfrogged davenport to take the world no. 1 ranking on september 12, 2005. she retained it for six weeks, but after playing few tournaments while injured, she again relinquished the ranking to davenport. to conclude the year, sharapova failed to defend her title at the year-end sony ericsson championships in los angeles, defeating davenport in one of her round-robin matches, but ultimately losing in the semifinals to eventual champion amã©lie mauresmo.

sharapova was the top seed at the australian open due to top-ranked justine henin's withdrawal. after being two points away from defeat in the first round against camille pin, she went on to reach the final of the tournament for the first time, but was routed there by serena williams who was ranked world no. 81 at the time. after reaching the final, sharapova recaptured the world no. 1 ranking. she held it for seven weeks, surrendering it back to henin after failing to defend her title at the pacific life open, instead losing in the fourth round to vera zvonareva after struggling with a hamstring injury. the following fortnight, she defeated venus williams in the third round of the sony ericsson open, before being beaten again by serena williams.

a shoulder injury forced sharapova to miss most of the clay-court season for the second consecutive year, resulting in her only tune-up for the french open being the ä°stanbul cup, where she lost in the semifinals to aravane rezaã¯. she reached the semifinals of the french open for the first time in her career, before losing to ana ivanovic. on grass, sharapova was runner-up to jelena jankoviä at the dfs classic. following that, she experienced her earliest wimbledon loss since 2003 by losing in the fourth round to eventual champion venus williams.

after the australian open, sharapova was nominated by team captain anastasia myskina to play the fed cup, but she had a forearm injury and was only listed for the doubles match. russia lost the first three matches and chose makarova to replace sharapova for the dead doubles match. in the end, russia lost 3â1 but by being nominated for the match, sharapova successfully qualified for the summer olympics having played sufficient fed cup matches to meet the criteria.

citing the left forearm injury sustained at the start of the year, sharapova withdrew from the qatar open, and a week before the bnp paribas open, she withdrew from that for the same reason.

following a failed drug test from the 2016 australian open, in which she tested positive for meldonium, a substance that had been banned, effective january 1, 2016 by the world anti-doping agency (wada), sharapova was provisionally suspended from competitive tennis with effect from march 12. on june 8 she was banned for two years by the international tennis federation. russian sports minister vitaly mutko has implied that sharapova was targeted due to the political crisis in russian-american relations. in october 2016, sharapova's ban was reduced from 24 months (2 years) to 15 months, starting from january 26, 2016, the date of the drug test she had failed.

on march 7, 2016, sharapova revealed that she had failed a drug test at the 2016 australian open, which she described as the result of an oversight. sharapova admitted to testing positive for meldonium, an anti-ischemic drug usually prescribed for heart conditions that was added to the world anti-doping agency (wada)'s banned substances list on january 1, 2016. sharapova was provisionally suspended by the international tennis federation (itf) from playing tennis effective from march 12, 2016. she later released a statement regarding the test and explaining her use of the medicine:

i received a letter from the itf that i failed a drugs test at the australian open. i take full responsibility for it. for the past ten years i have been given a medicine called mildronate by my family doctor and a few days ago after i received the itf letter i found out that it also has another name of meldonium which i did not know. it is very important for you to understand that for ten years this medicine was not on wada's banned list and i had legally been taking the medicine for the past ten years. but on january 1st [2016] the rules had changed and meldonium became a prohibited substance which i had not known. i was given this medicine by my doctor for several health issues that i was having in 2006.

meldonium is not approved for use in the united states, sharapova's country of residence; however, it is legal to use in russia, the country that sharapova represents in tennis. the drug's inventor ivars kalviåå¡ said that he did not think taking it should be construed as ""doping"", but he also said that it ""is very popular among athletes"" and was used by the soviet military for ""optimizing the use of oxygen"" and that it ""allows athletes to train under maximum strain"". don catlin, a long-time anti-doping expert and the scientific director of the banned substances control group (bscg) stated that ""there's really no evidence that there's any performance enhancement from meldonium â zero percent.""

sharapova said that she had been taking the drug to treat magnesium deficiency, an irregular ekg and family history of diabetes, and indicated that she had not read an email informing her that meldonium had been banned for use in tennis. meldonium's addition was outlined on a wada and united states anti-doping agency summary document and it has been reported that all tennis players were warned five times that it was due to be banned. on march 11, 2016, sharapova denied reports about the five missed warnings via facebook:

that's a distortion of the actual ""communications"" which were provided or simply posted onto a webpage. i make no excuses for not knowing about the ban. the other ""communications""? they were buried in newsletters, websites, or handouts (many of them technical, in small print). i didn't take the medicine every day. i took it the way my doctor recommended i take it and i took it in the low doses recommended. i'm proud of how i have played the game. i have been honest and upfront. i won't pretend to be injured so i can hide the truth about my testing.

most fellow tennis players reacted to sharapova's announcement with little support or sympathy. john mcenroe and pat cash said they found it hard to believe her. jennifer capriati posted on twitter that she should be stripped of her 35 professional titles. chris evert expressed her surprise at the lack of support in tennis for sharapova, noting that she ""[had] always isolated herself from the rest of the tennis world, from the players"". serena williams expressed surprise at sharapova's announcement but commended her for being ""upfront with what she had done"". roger federer, rafael nadal and andy murray all publicly condemned sharapova and argued that she deserved to be punished on the basis that she failed the doping test, with murray adding that ""taking a drug you don't necessarily need because it's legal is wrong"" and federer stating that ""whether it's intentional or not, i don't see too much difference. you must be 100 percent about what you are taking"". sharapova's case prompted federer to urge the tennis federation to conduct more anti-doping tests. novak djokovic said that he felt sorry for her, but that she must still be ready for punishment. the russian tennis federation strongly defended sharapova, describing the positive drug test as ""nonsense"" and adding that they expected sharapova to be available for the 2016 summer olympics.

as a result of the failed drug test, nike and tag heuer suspended their relationships with sharapova, while porsche postponed promotional work. racquet manufacturer head stood by sharapova, saying, ""we look forward to working with her"", and announced that they intended to extend their contract. they also suggested that wada should prove scientifically why the drug should be banned. the united nations development programme suspended sharapova from her role as a goodwill ambassador on march 16, while expressing thanks for her support of their work over the previous nine years.

on april 12, wada intimated that athletes who tested positive for meldonium before march 1 could avoid bans, but the international tennis federation said that sharapova's case would proceed. on june 8, the itf announced that sharapova would be suspended for two years. sharapova indicated she would appeal the ban.

following a hearing on 7 and 8 september 2016, the court of arbitration for sport (cas) panel found that sharapova had a reduced perception of the risk that she took while using mildronate, because (a) she had used mildronate for around ten years without any anti-doping issue, (b) she had consulted the russian doctor who prescribed the mildronate for medical reasons, not to enhance her performance, and (c) she had received no specific warning about the change in status of meldonium from wada, the itf, or the wta. however, the cas panel also noted sharapova's failure to disclose her use of meldonium on her doping control forms and that she was at fault for (a) failing to give her agent adequate instructions as to how to carry out the important task of checking the prohibited list, and (b) failing to supervise and control the actions of her agent in carrying out that task (specifically the lack of any procedure for reporting or follow-up verification to make sure that her agent had actually discharged his duty).

on october 4, the cas reduced the sanction imposed on sharapova by an independent tribunal from 24 months to 15 months. cas has released a statement on its official website stating:

ms. sharapova committed an anti-doping rule violation and that while it was with ""no significant fault"", she bore some degree of fault, for which a sanction of 15 months is appropriate.

sharapova has lived in the united states since moving there at the age of seven, but retains her russian citizenship, and is therefore eligible to play in the fed cup for russia. however, the behavior of sharapova's father during her matches on the wta tour, combined with a perceived lack of commitment by her to the fed cup, has made her selection for the russian fed cup team controversial in the past.

after sharapova had beaten fellow russian anastasia myskina at the 2004 wta tour championships, myskina criticized sharapova's father, saying: ""he was just yelling and screaming instructions to her and i thought he just might jump right on the court at one point in the match."" at the fed cup semifinals two weeks later, myskina stated she would stop playing for russia if sharapova joined the russian team the following season: ""if she joins our team next season you won't see me there for sure. his behaviour is totally incorrect, simply rude. i don't want to be around people like him."" larisa neiland, assistant to russia fed cup captain shamil tarpishchev, added: ""her father's behaviour (at the wta tour championships) was simply outrageous. i just don't see how he could work with the rest of us."" however, tarpishchev himself played down the problem, insisting: ""i feel that things will calm down soon and we'll have myskina, sharapova, kuznetsova and everyone else playing for russia.""

at the end of 2005, sharapova stated she was now keen to make her fed cup debut and was set to play against belgium in april 2006, but withdrew.
she later withdrew from ties against spain in april 2007 and against the united states in july 2007 because of injuries. the latter withdrawal led to russia's captain saying she would be ""ineligible for selection"" for the fed cup final in september. however, sharapova attended the final, cheering from the sidelines and acting as a ""hitting partner"" in practices, resulting in some of her russian teammates implying that she was attending only to enable her to play at the 2008 beijing olympics (rules state that players must have ""shown commitment"" to fed cup in order to play). svetlana kuznetsova said, ""she said she wanted to be our practice partner but if you can't play how then can you practice?""

sharapova finally made her fed cup debut in february 2008, in russia's quarterfinal tie against israel. she won both her singles rubbers, against tzipora obziler and shahar pe'er, helping russia to a 4â1 victory. for the semifinals, she was given permission to skip the tie, with tarpishchev announcing that she will be on the team for the final. however, the date of the final coincided with the lay-off from her shoulder injury, and thus she did not play.

in the 2011 first-round tie, sharapova played virginie razzano of france and lost. sharapova was supposed to play alizã© cornet but she was suffering from a viral illness. teammate anastasia pavlyuchenkova played and defeated cornet to secure the 3â2 win for russia against france. sharapova continued to participate in 2012 and helped russia to a 3â2 win against spain in the first-round tie. sharapova defeated silvia soler espinosa in the first rubber, but was unable to play her second rubber due to illness. in 2015, sharapova helped russia earn a place in the semifinals after beating pole urszula radwaåska in the first tie and her sister agnieszka radwaåska in the second tie. sharapova was scheduled to play the semi-final against germany, however, she withdrew days before the competition. she then joined the team for the final against czech republic and won both of her matches, against petra kvitovã¡ and karolã­na plã­å¡kovã¡. despite the 2 wins by sharapova, russia still lost 3â2 after losing the decisive doubles rubber.

sharapova is an aggressive baseliner with power, depth, and angles on her forehand and backhand. she is one of the few players on the wta tour who often use the reverse forehand. instead of using a traditional volley or overhead smash, she prefers to hit a powerful ""swinging"" volley when approaching the net or attacking lobs. sharapova is thought to have good speed around the court, especially considering her height. at the beginning of 2008, some observers noted that sharapova had developed her game, showing improved movement and footwork and the addition of a drop shot and sliced backhand to her repertoire of shots. despite her powerful game, sharapova's greatest asset is considered to be her mental toughness and competitive spirit, with nick bollettieri stating that she is ""tough as nails"". hall-of-famer john mcenroe said of sharapova, ""she's one of the best competitors in the history of the sport.""

sharapova is known for on-court ""grunting"", which reached a recorded 101 decibels during a match at wimbledon in 2005. during her second round match in birmingham in 2003, sharapova was asked to tone down the level of her grunt after opponent nathalie dechy complained to the umpire, with sharapova's response saying that her grunting was ""a natural instinct."" monica seles suggested that grunting is involuntary and a part of tennis. when questioned by the media about her grunting, sharapova urged the media to ""just watch the match."" her defensive game has been worked on by her new coach, and this has reflected in her results, making consecutive semi-finals at premier mandatory events on the tour. later in her career, sharapova also added drop shots to her repertoire, making for a more unpredictable game style.

early in her career, sharapova's first and second serves were regarded as powerful, and she was believed to possess one of the best deliveries on the tour. since the beginning of 2007, however, problems with her shoulder have reduced the effectiveness of her serve. the shoulder injury resulted in not only her inconsistent first serves, but also her hitting high numbers of double faults. two-time us open singles champion tracy austin believes that sharapova often loses confidence in the rest of her game when she experiences problems with her serve and consequently produces more unforced errors and generally plays more tentatively, while tennis writer joel drucker remarked that her serve was the ""catalyst for her entire game"", and that her struggles with it left her ""unmasked.""

in her return from layoff in 2008 to 2009, she used an abbreviated motion, which was somewhat less powerful, and though producing aces, also gave a very high number of double faults. after her early loss at the 2009 us open, sharapova returned to a more elongated motion, similar to her pre-surgery serve. she has since been able to produce speeds greater than before, including a 121-mph serve hit at the birmingham tournament in 2010 â the fastest serve of her career.

however, since her shoulder operation sharapova has been unable to control her serve. this has led to numerous faults, as she is unable to feel how much power she is generating. the new action led to an elbow injury, and, although under thomas hã¶gstedt it has improved, it can still be erratic. this improvement in serving can be seen in the 2013 australian open and following tournaments where maria sharapova committed fewer double faults than in previous years.

because she predicates her game on power, sharapova's preferred surfaces early in her career were the fast-playing hard and grass courts, as evident through her 25 victories on hard court and grass court. this was most notable when she won the 2004 wimbledon, 2006 u.s. open and 2008 australian open crowns, where she had her career breakthrough and played her peak tennis level, respectively.

sharapova initially was not as well-suited to the slower clay courts as she is on hard and grass courts. sharapova admitted in 2007 that she was not as comfortable with her movement on clay compared with other court surfaces and once described herself as like a ""cow on ice"" after a match on clay, due to her inability to slide. later in her career, she showed improvement on this surface with respect to experience, as evidenced with her first wta red-clay title at the 2010 internationaux de strasbourg, 7 years since playing on the wta circuit. she won her first french open title and captured the career grand slam at the 2012 french open and as of 2014, led the wta tour of active players with the highest winning percentage on clay, with an 84.25% winning rate. since her shoulder injury, her best surface has become clay over grass & hard courts, and with her victory at the 2014 french open, she has now won the french open twice, which is more times than she has won any other slam, and three out of her four last grand slam finals have all been at the french open (3 consecutive finals from 2012â2014).

sharapova has had multiple coaches throughout her career including: robert lansdorp, yuri sharapov, michael joyce from 2004â11, jimmy connors in 2013, and sven groeneveld 2013â2018. thomas hã¶gstedt from 2011â13, 2018-2019.

in 2011, sharapova was engaged to slovenian professional basketball player sasha vujaäiä, with whom she had been in a relationship since 2009. on august 31, 2012, sharapova confirmed that the pair had ended the engagement and separated earlier that year.

sharapova has lived in the united states since moving there at the age of seven. besides a home in bradenton, florida, she also has a residence in manhattan beach, california.
from 2005 to 2011, sharapova was named to the forbes celebrity 100, which attempts to compile the top 100 most powerful celebrities of that year.
sharapova has made varying remarks on how long she intends to maintain her tennis career. following the retirement of 25-year-old justine henin in 2008, sharapova said, ""if i [were] 25, and i'd won so many grand slams, i'd quit too."" in an interview after the 2008 australian open, she balked at the idea of playing for another ten years, saying that she hoped to have a ""nice husband and a few kids"" by then. however, in an interview before her 2012 australian open semifinal, sharapova changed her stance, saying she intended to continue playing tennis for as long as she enjoyed playing the game. sharapova stated, ""i'm sure when i was 17 years old and someone said, you'll be playing for another eight years, it would be like, you're not going to see me at a press conference at 25 years old. but years go on. i missed a year in my careerâi didn't play that year. i've said this, just before the tournament, a few weeks before, i woke up, and i was just so happy to be going back on the court. i felt so fresh, full of energy, just with a really good perspective. times change, obviously. i see myself playing this sport for many more years because it's something that gives me the most pleasure in my life. i think it helps when you know you're good at something, and you can always improve it. it obviously helps with the encouragement.""

although a united states resident since 1994, sharapova still prefers russian citizenship. sharapova has stated the reason she prefers to keep russian citizenship is because ""it is about the family environment, it is about the rich culture. just life experiences that i look back to and i know that for so many years i was shaped into the individual i was from those experiences. and not necessarily simply the country, but the people, the mentality and the toughness and that never giving up attitude"".

the maria sharapova foundation is committed to helping children around the world achieve their dreams. sharapova has donated $100,000 to chernobyl-related projects. in partnership with the undp, she launched a $210,000 scholarship program for students from chernobyl-affected areas of belarus that will award five-year scholarships to 12 students at the belarusian state academy of arts and the belarusian state university. at the 2004 us open, sharapova, along with several other russian female tennis players, wore a black ribbon in observance of the tragedy after the beslan school hostage crisis, which took place only days before. in 2005, she donated around us$50,000 to those affected by the crisis. on february 14, 2007, sharapova was appointed a goodwill ambassador for the united nations development programme (undp) and donated us$210,000 to undp chernobyl-recovery projects. she stated at the time that she was planning to travel back to the area after wimbledon in 2008, though it didn't happen since she had to travel back to the us because of her shoulder injury. she fulfilled the trip in late june/early july 2010. sharapova has helped to promote the 2014 winter olympics in sochi, russia, and was the first torch bearer in the torch-lighting ceremony during the opening festivities. in addition, with angela haynes, maria kirilenko, nicole vaidiå¡ovã¡, rennae stubbs, governor jeb bush, and jennifer capriati, sharapova participated in an exhibition in tampa in december 2004, raising money for the florida hurricane relief fund. in july 2008, sharapova sent a message on dvd to the memorial service of cancer victim emily bailes, who had performed the coin toss ahead of the 2004 wimbledon final that sharapova had gone on to win.

sharapova's autobiography, ""unstoppable: my life so far"" was published on september 12, 2017, by sarah crichton books.

sharapova's tennis success and appearance have enabled her to secure commercial endorsements that greatly exceed the value of her tournament winnings. in march 2006, forbes magazine listed her as the highest-paid female athlete in the world, with annual earnings of over us$18â million, the majority of which was from endorsements and sponsorships. she topped that list every year until 2016, even after her 2007 shoulder injury. in 2011, ""forbes"" listed sharapova as no. 29 in their list of 50 top-paid athletes, the only woman on the list. in 2012, she was listed as no. 15, and was joined in the top 20 by li na at no. 16 and serena williams at no. 17. in april 2005, ""people"" named her one of the 50 most beautiful celebrities in the world. in 2006, ""maxim"" ranked sharapova the hottest athlete in the world for the fourth consecutive year. she posed in a six-page bikini photoshoot spread in the 2006 valentine's day issue of the ""sports illustrated swimsuit issue"", alongside 25 supermodels. in a poll run by britain's ""fhm"" magazine, she was voted the seventh most eligible bachelorette, based on both ""wealth and looks.""

immediately after her win at the 2004 wimbledon championship, mobile phone company motorola signed sharapova to endorse their mobile phone line. additionally, she appeared in commercials for land rover and canon, as well as approved of namesake items by watch brand tag heuer and jeweller tiffany. tiffany also provides sharapova with earrings from the ""tiffany for maria sharapova"" collection at the four major events, that are also retailed globally. she also starred in an award-winning campaign for the sports clothing brand nike, ""pretty"", in the summer of 2006. she signed a sponsorship deal in january 2007 with gatorade and tropicana, which ended in 2009. in 2007, sharapova was featured in a number of canon usa's commercials for the powershot. sharapova has also been depicted in many tennis-related video games. some of the titles include the ""top spin series"", ""virtua tennis"" series, and ""grand slam tennis"" series. during the layoff due to her shoulder surgery, sensing the fleeting nature of a professional athlete's career, sharapova decided to focus on developing her name as a brand, beginning with meeting with her sponsors more extensively to further her brand. in january 2010, it was announced that sharapova had renewed her contract with nike, signing an 8-year deal for $70â million. this is the most lucrative deal ever for a sportswoman, dwarfing the previous record, which was venus williams' $43â million deal with reebok.

following in the footsteps of tennis players who started clothing lines such as fred perry and renã© lacoste, sharapova launched her own tennis apparel line, the ""nike maria sharapova collection"", in 2010. the collection includes dresses that she designed for all the major tournaments, in collaboration with nike and cole haan. she had previously found that the outfits given to her by nike did not suit her frame and were worn by too many other players. she comes up with design ideas and sketches in a process that begins 18 months before the event and receives royalties from the sale of the collection, of which the corresponding dresses are coordinated to be available simultaneously with the corresponding major tournament. the collection is worn by other wta players, including sofia arvidsson, eugenie bouchard, kai-chen chang, andrea hlavã¡äkovã¡, madison keys, anastasia pivovarova as well as junior players such as indy de vroome. sharapova had earlier collaborated with nike on the ""little black dress"" that she wore for her night matches at the 2006 us open. the dress featured a round crystal studded collar and was inspired by audrey hepburn. the dress was well publicized and received but was not mass-produced. additionally, she designs shoes and handbags for cole haan, for which her signature ballerina flats are one of the biggest sellers of the entire brand.

sharapova used the prince triple threat hornet for part of 2003 and then used several different prince racquets until the us open. she gave the racquet she used in the 2004 wimbledon final to regis philbin when taping ""live with regis and kelly"". sharapova began using the prince shark os at that tournament specially designed for her. she then switched to the prince o3 white racquet in january 2006. she switched to the prince o3 speedport black in july 2008. after being with prince for ten years, sharapova began endorsing head racquets in 2011 and uses the head youtek ig instinct. sharapova signed a three-year deal to be brand ambassador for porsche in 2013.

""sugarpova"" is a candy line created by maria sharapova and candy veteran jeff rubin, founder of international retailer it'sugar. according to the sugarpova website, ""sugarpova is a premium candy line that reflects the fun, fashionable, sweet side of international tennis sensation maria sharapova."" a portion of all proceeds goes to the maria sharapova foundation, sharapova's charity. sugarpova was launched worldwide in 2013. in february 2016, sugarpova announced that it had partnered with polish company ""baron chocolatier"" to make sugarpova premium chocolates. sugarpova also plans to extend its range to lifestyle products.

steve jobs,"
steven paul jobs (; february 24, 1955 â october 5, 2011) was an american business magnate, entrepreneur, industrial designer, investor, and media proprietor. he was the chairman, chief executive officer (ceo), and co-founder of apple inc., the chairman and majority shareholder of pixar, a member of the walt disney company's board of directors following its acquisition of pixar, and the founder, chairman, and ceo of next. jobs is widely recognized as a pioneer of the microcomputer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s, along with apple co-founder steve wozniak.

jobs was born in san francisco, california, and put up for adoption. he was raised in the san francisco bay area. he attended reed college in 1972 before dropping out that same year, and traveled through india in 1974 seeking enlightenment and studying zen buddhism. his declassified fbi report states that he used marijuana and lsd while he was in college, and once told a reporter that taking lsd was ""one of the two or three most important things"" he had done in his life.

jobs and wozniak co-founded apple in 1976 to sell wozniak's apple i personal computer. together the duo gained fame and wealth a year later with the apple ii, one of the first highly successful mass-produced personal computers. jobs saw the commercial potential of the xerox alto in 1979, which was mouse-driven and had a graphical user interface (gui). this led to development of the unsuccessful apple lisa in 1983, followed by the breakthrough macintosh in 1984, the first mass-produced computer with a gui. the macintosh introduced the desktop publishing industry in 1985 with the addition of the apple laserwriter, the first laser printer to feature vector graphics. jobs was forced out of apple in 1985 after a long power struggle with the company's board and its then-ceo john sculley. that same year, jobs took a few of apple's members with him to found next, a computer platform development company that specialized in computers for higher-education and business markets. in addition, he helped to develop the visual effects industry when he funded the computer graphics division of george lucas's lucasfilm in 1986. the new company was pixar, which produced the first 3d computer animated film ""toy story"" (1995).

apple merged with next in 1997, and jobs became ceo of his former company within a few months. he was largely responsible for helping revive apple, which had been at the verge of bankruptcy. he worked closely with designer jony ive to develop a line of products that had larger cultural ramifications, beginning in 1997 with the ""think different"" advertising campaign and leading to the imac, itunes, itunes store, apple store, ipod, iphone, app store, and the ipad. in 2001, the original mac os was replaced with a completely new mac os x, based on next's nextstep platform, giving the os a modern unix-based foundation for the first time. jobs was diagnosed with a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor in 2003. he died of respiratory arrest related to the tumor at age 56 on october 5, 2011.

steven paul jobs was born on february 24, 1955, to abdulfattah jandali and joanne schieble, and was adopted by paul and clara jobs (nã©e hagopian).

his biological father, abdulfattah ""john"" (al-)jandali (arabic: ø¹ø¨ø¯ ø§ùùøªø§ø­ ø§ùø¬ùø¯ùù) (b. 1931), grew up in homs, syria, and was born into an arab muslim household. while an undergraduate at the american university of beirut, lebanon, he was a student activist and spent time in jail for his political activities. he pursued a phd at the university of wisconsin, where he met joanne carole schieble, a catholic of swiss and german descent. as a doctoral candidate, jandali was a teaching assistant for a course schieble was taking, although both were the same age. mona simpson, jobs's biological sister, notes that her maternal grandparents were not happy that their daughter was dating a muslim. walter isaacson, steve jobs's official biographer, additionally states that schieble's father ""threatened to cut joanne off completely"" if she continued the relationship.

jobs's adoptive father, paul reinhold jobs, was a coast guard mechanic. after leaving the coast guard, paul jobs married clara hagopian in 1946. clara, the daughter of armenian immigrants, grew up in san francisco. paul jobs was a ""repo man"" who repaired cars. their attempts to start a family were halted after clara had an ectopic pregnancy, leading them to consider adoption in 1955.

schieble became pregnant with jobs in 1954 when she and jandali spent the summer with his family in homs, syria. jandali has stated that he ""was very much in love with joanne ... but sadly, her father was a tyrant, and forbade her to marry me, as i was from syria. and so she told me she wanted to give the baby up for adoption."" according to jandali, schieble deliberately did not involve him in the process: ""without telling me, joanne upped and left to move to san francisco to have the baby without anyone knowing, including me ... she did not want to bring shame onto the family and thought this was the best for everyone.""

schieble gave birth to jobs on february 24, 1955 in san francisco and chose an adoptive couple for him that was ""catholic, well-educated, and wealthy."" the couple changed their mind, however, and decided to adopt a girl instead. the baby boy was then placed with paul and clara jobs, neither of whom had a college education, and schieble refused to sign the adoption papers. she then took the matter to court in an attempt to have her baby placed with a different family and only consented to releasing the baby to paul and clara after they promised that he would attend college. when steve jobs was in high school, his mother clara admitted to his girlfriend, 17-year-old chrisann brennan, that she ""was too frightened to love [steve] for the first six months of his life ... i was scared they were going to take him away from me. even after we won the case, steve was so difficult a child that by the time he was two i felt we had made a mistake. i wanted to return him."" when chrisann shared his mother's comment with steve, he stated that he was already aware of that and would later say he was deeply loved and indulged by paul and clara. many years later, steve jobs's wife laurene also noted that ""he felt he had been really blessed by having the two of them as parents."" jobs would become upset when paul and clara were referred to as his ""adoptive parents""; he regarded them as his parents ""1,000%"". with regard to his biological parents, jobs referred to them as ""my sperm and egg bank. that's not harsh, it's just the way it was, a sperm bank thing, nothing more.""

paul and clara adopted jobs's sister patricia in 1957 and the family moved to mountain view, california, in 1961. it was during this time that paul built a workbench in his garage for his son in order to ""pass along his love of mechanics."" jobs, meanwhile, admired his father's craftsmanship ""because he knew how to build anything. if we needed a cabinet, he would build it. when he built our fence, he gave me a hammer so i could work with him ... i wasn't that into fixing cars ... but i was eager to hang out with my dad."" by the time he was ten, jobs was deeply involved in electronics and befriended many of the engineers who lived in the neighborhood. he had difficulty making friends with children his own age, however, and was seen by his classmates as a ""loner.""

jobs had difficulty functioning in a traditional classroom, tended to resist authority figures, frequently misbehaved, and was suspended a few times. clara had taught him to read as a toddler, and jobs stated that he was ""pretty bored in school and [had] turned into a little terror... you should have seen us in the third grade, we basically destroyed the teacher."" he frequently played pranks on others at monta loma elementary school in mountain view. his father paul (who was abused as a child) never reprimanded him, however, and instead blamed the school for not challenging his brilliant son.

jobs would later credit his fourth grade teacher, imogene ""teddy"" hill, with turning him around: ""she taught an advanced fourth grade class and it took her about a month to get hip to my situation. she bribed me into learning. she would say, 'i really want you to finish this workbook. i'll give you five bucks if you finish it.' that really kindled a passion in me for learning things! i learned more that year than i think i learned in any other year in school. they wanted me to skip the next two years in grade school and go straight to junior high to learn a foreign language but my parents very wisely wouldn't let it happen."" jobs skipped the fifth grade and transferred to the sixth grade at crittenden middle school in mountain view where he became a ""socially awkward loner"". jobs ""was often bullied"" and gave his parents an ultimatum: they had to either take him out of crittenden or he would drop out of school.

though the jobs family was not well off, they used all their savings in 1967 to buy a new home, allowing jobs to change schools. the new house (a three-bedroom home on crist drive in los altos, california) was in the better cupertino school district, cupertino, california, and was embedded in an environment that was even more heavily populated with engineering families than the mountain view area was. the house was declared a historic site in 2013, as it was the first site for apple computer; as of 2013, it was owned by patty and occupied by jobs's step-mother, marilyn.

when he was 13 in 1968, jobs was given a summer job by bill hewlett (of hewlett-packard) after jobs cold-called him to ask for parts for an electronics project.

the location of the los altos home meant that jobs would be able to attend nearby homestead high school, which had strong ties to silicon valley. he began his first year there in late 1968 along with fernandez. neither jobs nor fernandez (whose father was a lawyer) came from engineering households and thus decided to enroll in john mccollum's ""electronics 1."" mccollum and the rebellious jobs (who had grown his hair long and become involved in the growing counterculture) would eventually clash and jobs began to lose interest in the class.

he underwent a change during mid-1970: ""i got stoned for the first time; i discovered shakespeare, dylan thomas, and all that classic stuff. i read moby dick and went back as a junior taking creative writing classes."" jobs also later noted to his official biographer that ""i started to listen to music a whole lot, and i started to read more outside of just science and technologyâshakespeare, plato. i loved ""king lear"" ... when i was a senior i had this phenomenal ap english class. the teacher was this guy who looked like ernest hemingway. he took a bunch of us snowshoeing in yosemite."" from that point, jobs developed two different circles of friends: those who were involved in electronics and engineering and those who were interested in art and literature. these dual interests were particularly reflected during jobs's senior year as his best friends were wozniak and his first girlfriend, the artistic homestead junior chrisann brennan.

in 1971 after wozniak began attending university of california, berkeley, jobs would visit him there a few times a week. this experience led him to study in nearby stanford university's student union. jobs also decided that rather than join the electronics club, he would put on light shows with a friend for homestead's avant-garde jazz program. he was described by a homestead classmate as ""kind of a brain and kind of a hippie ... but he never fit into either group. he was smart enough to be a nerd, but wasn't nerdy. and he was too intellectual for the hippies, who just wanted to get wasted all the time. he was kind of an outsider. in high school everything revolved around what group you were in, and if you weren't in a carefully defined group, you weren't anybody. he was an individual, in a world where individuality was suspect."" by his senior year in late 1971, he was taking freshman english class at stanford and working on a homestead underground film project with chrisann brennan. in mid-1972, after graduation and before leaving for reed college, jobs and brennan rented a house from their other roommate, al.

later in the year, jobs enrolled at reed college in portland, oregon. reed was an expensive school that paul and clara could ill afford, and they were spending much of their life savings on their son's higher education. brennan remained involved with jobs while he was at reed. she also met his friend at reed, daniel kottke, for the first time. jobs also became friends with reed's student body president, robert friedland.

brennan was now a senior at homestead, and she did not have plans to attend college. she was supportive of jobs when he told her that he planned to drop out of reed because he did not want to spend his parents' money on it (neither her father nor jobs's adoptive parents had gone to college). jobs continued to attend by auditing his classes, which included a course on calligraphy that was taught by robert palladino. jobs was no longer an official student, and brennan stopped visiting him. jobs later asked her to come and live with him in a house he rented near the reed campus, but she refused. in a 2005 commencement speech at stanford university, jobs stated that during this period, he slept on the floor in friends' dorm rooms, returned coke bottles for food money, and got weekly free meals at the local hare krishna temple. in that same speech, jobs said: ""if i had never dropped in on that single calligraphy course in college, the mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts.""

in mid-1973, jobs moved back to the san francisco bay area and was renting his own apartment. jobs hitchhiked and worked around the west coast and brennan would occasionally join him. jobs and brennan remained involved with each other while continuing to see other people.
in 1973, steve wozniak designed his own version of the classic video game ""pong"". after finishing it, wozniak gave the board to jobs, who then took the game down to atari, inc. in los gatos, california. atari thought that jobs had built it and gave him a job as a technician. atari's cofounder nolan bushnell later described him as ""difficult but valuable"", pointing out that ""he was very often the smartest guy in the room, and he would let people know that.""

by early 1974, jobs was living what brennan describes as a ""simple life"" in a los gatos cabin, working at atari, and saving money for his impending trip to india.

jobs traveled to india in mid-1974 to visit neem karoli baba at his kainchi ashram with his reed friend (and eventual apple employee) daniel kottke, in search of spiritual enlightenment. when they got to the neem karoli ashram, it was almost deserted because neem karoli baba had died in september 1973. then they made a long trek up a dry riverbed to an ashram of haidakhan babaji.

after seven months, jobs left india and returned to the us ahead of daniel kottke. jobs had changed his appearance; his head was shaved and he wore traditional indian clothing. during this time, jobs experimented with psychedelics, later calling his lsd experiences ""one of the two or three most important things [he had] done in [his] life"". he spent a period at the all one farm, a commune in oregon that was owned by robert friedland. brennan joined him there for a period.

during this time period, jobs and brennan both became practitioners of zen buddhism through the zen master kåbun chino otogawa. jobs was living in his parents' backyard toolshed, which he had converted into a bedroom. jobs engaged in lengthy meditation retreats at the tassajara zen mountain center, the oldest såtå zen monastery in the us. he considered taking up monastic residence at eihei-ji in japan, and maintained a lifelong appreciation for zen.

jobs then returned to atari and was assigned to create a circuit board for the arcade video game ""breakout"". according to bushnell, atari offered for each ttl chip that was eliminated in the machine. jobs had little specialized knowledge of circuit board design and made a deal with wozniak to split the fee evenly between them if wozniak could minimize the number of chips. much to the amazement of atari engineers, wozniak reduced the ttl count to 46, a design so tight that it was impossible to reproduce on an assembly line. according to wozniak, jobs told him that atari gave them only $700 (instead of the $5,000 paid out), and that wozniak's share was thus $350. wozniak did not learn about the actual bonus until ten years later, but said that if jobs had told him about it and explained that he needed the money, wozniak would have given it to him.

wozniak had designed a low-cost digital ""blue box"" to generate the necessary tones to manipulate the telephone network, allowing free long-distance calls. jobs decided that they could make money selling it. the clandestine sales of the illegal ""blue boxes"" went well and perhaps planted the seed in jobs's mind that electronics could be both fun and profitable. jobs, in a 1994 interview, recalled that it took six months for him and wozniak to figure out how to build the blue boxes. jobs said that if not for the blue boxes, there would have been no apple. he states it showed them that they could take on large companies and beat them.

jobs and wozniak attended meetings of the homebrew computer club in 1975, which was a stepping stone to the development and marketing of the first apple computer.

in 1976, wozniak designed and developed the apple i computer and showed it to jobs, who suggested that they sell it. that same year, jobs, wozniak, and administrative supervisor ronald wayne founded apple computer (now called apple inc.) in the garage of jobs's los altos home on crist drive. wayne stayed only a short time, leaving jobs and wozniak as the active primary cofounders of the company. the two decided on the name ""apple"" after jobs returned from the all one farm commune in oregon and told wozniak about his time spent in the farm's apple orchard. a neighbor on crist drive recalled jobs as an odd individual who would greet his clients ""with his underwear hanging out, barefoot and hippie-like"". another neighbor, larry waterland, who had just earned his phd in chemical engineering at stanford, recalled dismissing jobs's budding business: ""'you punched cards, put them in a big deck,' he said about the mainframe machines of that time. 'steve took me over to the garage. he had a circuit board with a chip on it, a dumont tv set, a panasonic cassette tape deck and a keyboard. he said, 'this is an apple computer.' i said, 'you've got to be joking.' i dismissed the whole idea.'"" jobs's friend from reed college and india, daniel kottke, recalled that as an early apple employee, he ""was the only person who worked in the garage ... woz would show up once a week with his latest code. steve jobs didn't get his hands dirty in that sense."" kottke also stated that much of the early work took place in jobs's kitchen, where he spent hours on the phone trying to find investors for the company.

they received funding from a then-semi-retired intel product marketing manager and engineer mike markkula. scott mcnealy, one of the cofounders of sun microsystems, said that jobs broke a ""glass age ceiling"" in silicon valley because he'd created a very successful company at a young age. markkula brought apple to the attention of arthur rock, which after looking at the crowded apple booth at the home brew computer show, started with a $60,000 investment and went on the apple board.

after brennan returned from her own journey to india, she and jobs fell in love again, as brennan noted changes in him that she attributes to kobun (whom she was also still following). it was also at this time that jobs displayed a prototype apple computer for brennan and his parents in their living room. brennan notes a shift in this time period, where the two main influences on jobs were apple and kobun. by early 1977, she and jobs would spend time together at her home at duveneck ranch in los altos, which served as a hostel and environmental education center. brennan also worked there as a teacher for inner city children who came to learn about the farm.

in 1977, jobs and wozniak introduced the apple ii at the west coast computer faire. it was the first consumer product sold by apple computer and was one of the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputer products in the world, and was primarily designed by wozniak. jobs oversaw the development of the apple ii's unusual case and rod holt developed the unique power supply.

jobs usually went to work wearing a black long-sleeved mock turtleneck made by issey miyake (it was sometimes reported as st. croix brand), levi's 501 blue jeans, and new balance 991 sneakers. he said his choice was inspired by that of stuart geman, a noted applied mathematics professor at brown university. jobs told his biographer walter isaacson ""...he came to like the idea of having a uniform for himself, both because of its daily convenience (the rationale he claimed) and its ability to convey a signature style.""

as jobs became more successful with his new company, his relationship with brennan grew more complex. in 1977, the success of apple was now a part of their relationship, and brennan, daniel kottke, and jobs moved into a house near the apple office in cupertino. brennan eventually took a position in the shipping department at apple. brennan's relationship with jobs deteriorated as his position with apple grew, and she began to consider ending the relationship. in october 1977, brennan was approached by rod holt, who asked her to take ""a paid apprenticeship designing blueprints for the apples"". both holt and jobs believed that it would be a good position for her, given her artistic abilities. holt was particularly eager that she take the position and puzzled by her ambivalence toward it. brennan's decision, however, was overshadowed by the fact that she realized she was pregnant and that jobs was the father. it took her a few days to tell jobs, whose face, according to brennan ""turned ugly"" at the news. at the same time, according to brennan, at the beginning of her third trimester, jobs said to her: ""i never wanted to ask that you get an abortion. i just didn't want to do that."" he also refused to discuss the pregnancy with her. brennan turned down the internship and decided to leave apple. she stated that jobs told her ""if you give up this baby for adoption, you will be sorry"" and ""i am never going to help you."" according to brennan, jobs ""started to seed people with the notion that i slept around and he was infertile, which meant that this could not be his child."" a few weeks before she was due to give birth, brennan was invited to deliver her baby at the all one farm. she accepted the offer. when jobs was 23 (the same age as his biological parents when they had him) brennan gave birth to her baby, lisa brennan, on may 17, 1978. jobs went there for the birth after he was contacted by robert friedland, their mutual friend and the farm owner. while distant, jobs worked with her on a name for the baby, which they discussed while sitting in the fields on a blanket. brennan suggested the name ""lisa"" which jobs also liked and notes that jobs was very attached to the name ""lisa"" while he ""was also publicly denying paternity."" she would discover later that during this time, jobs was preparing to unveil a new kind of computer that he wanted to give a female name (his first choice was ""claire"" after st. clare). she also stated that she never gave him permission to use the baby's name for a computer and he hid the plans from her. jobs also worked with his team to come up with the phrase, ""local integrated software architecture"" as an alternative explanation for the apple lisa. decades later, however, jobs admitted to his biographer walter isaacson that ""obviously, it was named for my daughter"".

when jobs denied paternity, a dna test established him as lisa's father. it required him to give brennan $385 a month in addition to returning the welfare money she had received. jobs gave her $500 a month at the time when apple went public and jobs became a millionaire. later, brennan agreed to give an interview with michael moritz for ""time"" magazine for its time person of the year special, released on january 3, 1983, in which she discussed her relationship with jobs. rather than name jobs the person of the year, the magazine named the computer the ""machine of the year"". in the issue, jobs questioned the reliability of the paternity test (which stated that the ""probability of paternity for jobs, steven... is 94.1%""). jobs responded by arguing that ""28% of the male population of the united states could be the father"". ""time"" also noted that ""the baby girl and the machine on which apple has placed so much hope for the future share the same name: lisa"".

jobs was worth over $1 million in 1978 when he was just 23 years old. his net worth grew to over $250 million by the time he was 25, according to estimates. he was also one of the youngest ""people ever to make the forbes list of the nation's richest peopleâand one of only a handful to have done it themselves, without inherited wealth"".

in 1978, apple recruited mike scott from national semiconductor to serve as ceo for what turned out to be several turbulent years. in 1983, jobs lured john sculley away from pepsi-cola to serve as apple's ceo, asking, ""do you want to spend the rest of your life selling sugared water, or do you want a chance to change the world?""

in 1982, jobs bought an apartment in the two top floors of the san remo, a manhattan building with a politically progressive reputation. although he never lived there, he spent years renovating it with the help of i. m. pei. in 2003, he sold it to u2 singer bono.

in 1984, jobs bought the jackling house and estate, and resided there for a decade. after that, he leased it out for several years until 2000 when he stopped maintaining the house, allowing exposure to the weather to degrade it. in 2004, jobs received permission from the town of woodside to demolish the house in order to build a smaller contemporary styled one. after a few years in court, the house was finally demolished in 2011, a few months before he died.
in early 1984, apple introduced the macintosh, which was based on the lisa (and xerox parc's mouse-driven graphical user interface) and conceived by early apple employee jef raskin. the following year, apple aired a super bowl television commercial titled ""1984"". at apple's annual shareholders meeting on january 24, 1984, an emotional jobs introduced the macintosh to a wildly enthusiastic audience; andy hertzfeld described the scene as ""pandemonium"".

though marketed and received in fanfare, the expensive macintosh was a hard sell. shortly after its release in 1985, bill gates's then-developing company, microsoft, threatened to stop developing mac applications unless it was granted ""a license for the mac operating system software. microsoft was developing its graphical user interface ... for dos, which it was calling windows and didn't want apple to sue over the similarities between the windows gui and the mac interface."" sculley granted microsoft the license which later led to problems for apple. in addition, cheap ibm pc clones that ran on microsoft software and had a graphical user interface began to appear. although the macintosh preceded the clones, it was far more expensive, so ""through the late 1980s, the windows user interface was getting better and better and was thus taking increasingly more share from apple"". windows-based ibm-pc clones also led to the development of additional guis such as ibm's topview or digital research's gem, and thus ""the graphical user interface was beginning to be taken for granted, undermining the most apparent advantage of the mac...it seemed clear as the 1980s wound down that apple couldn't go it alone indefinitely against the whole ibm-clone market.""
sculley's and jobs's respective visions for the company greatly differed. the former favored open architecture computers like the apple ii, sold to education, small business, and home markets less vulnerable to ibm. jobs wanted the company to focus on the closed architecture macintosh as a business alternative to the ibm pc. president and ceo sculley had little control over chairman of the board jobs's macintosh division; it and the apple ii division operated like separate companies, duplicating services. although its products provided 85 percent of apple's sales in early 1985, the company's january 1985 annual meeting did not mention the apple ii division or employees. many left including wozniak, who stated that the company had ""been going in the wrong direction for the last five years"" and sold most of his stock. the macintosh's failure to defeat the pc strengthened sculley's position in the company.

in may 1985, sculleyâencouraged by arthur rockâdecided to reorganize apple, and proposed a plan to the board that would remove jobs from the macintosh group and put him in charge of ""new product development"". this move would effectively render jobs powerless within apple. in response, jobs then developed a plan to get rid of sculley and take over apple. however, jobs was confronted after the plan was leaked, and he said that he would leave apple. the board declined his resignation and asked him to reconsider. sculley also told jobs that he had all of the votes needed to go ahead with the reorganization. a few months later, on september 17, 1985, jobs submitted a letter of resignation to the apple board. five additional senior apple employees also resigned and joined jobs in his new venture, next.

following his resignation from apple in 1985, jobs founded next inc. with $7â million. a year later he was running out of money, and he sought venture capital with no product on the horizon. eventually, jobs attracted the attention of billionaire ross perot, who invested heavily in the company. the next computer was shown to the world in what was considered jobs's comeback event, a lavish invitation only gala launch event that was described as a multimedia extravaganza. the celebration was held at the louise m. davies symphony hall, san francisco, california on wednesday october 12, 1988. steve wozniak said in a 2013 interview that while jobs was at next he was ""really getting his head together"".

next workstations were first released in 1990 and priced at . like the apple lisa, the next workstation was technologically advanced and designed for the education sector, but was largely dismissed as cost-prohibitive for educational institutions. the next workstation was known for its technical strengths, chief among them its object-oriented software development system. jobs marketed next products to the financial, scientific, and academic community, highlighting its innovative, experimental new technologies, such as the mach kernel, the digital signal processor chip, and the built-in ethernet port. making use of a next computer, english computer scientist tim berners-lee invented the world wide web in 1990 at cern in switzerland.

the revised, second generation nextcube was released in 1990. jobs touted it as the first ""interpersonal"" computer that would replace the personal computer. with its innovative nextmail multimedia email system, nextcube could share voice, image, graphics, and video in email for the first time. ""interpersonal computing is going to revolutionize human communications and groupwork"", jobs told reporters. jobs ran next with an obsession for aesthetic perfection, as evidenced by the development of and attention to nextcube's magnesium case. this put considerable strain on next's hardware division, and in 1993, after having sold only 50,000 machines, next transitioned fully to software development with the release of nextstep/intel. the company reported its first profit of $1.03â million in 1994. in 1996, next software, inc. released webobjects, a framework for web application development. after next was acquired by apple inc. in 1997, webobjects was used to build and run the apple store, mobileme services, and the itunes store.

in 1986, jobs funded the spinout of the graphics group (later renamed pixar) from lucasfilm's computer graphics division for the price of $10â million, $5â million of which was given to the company as capital and $5â million of which was paid to lucasfilm for technology rights.

the first film produced by pixar with its disney partnership, ""toy story"" (1995), with jobs credited as executive producer, brought fame and critical acclaim to the studio when it was released. over the next 15 years, under pixar's creative chief john lasseter, the company produced box-office hits ""a bug's life"" (1998); ""toy story 2"" (1999); ""monsters, inc."" (2001); ""finding nemo"" (2003); ""the incredibles"" (2004); ""cars"" (2006); ""ratatouille"" (2007); ""wall-e"" (2008); ""up"" (2009); and ""toy story 3"" (2010). ""finding nemo"", ""the incredibles"", ""ratatouille"", ""wall-e"", ""up"" and ""toy story 3"" each received the academy award for best animated feature, an award introduced in 2001.

in 2003 and 2004, as pixar's contract with disney was running out, jobs and disney chief executive michael eisner tried but failed to negotiate a new partnership, and in january 2004, jobs announced that he would never deal with disney again. pixar would seek a new partner to distribute its films after its contract expired.

in october 2005, bob iger replaced eisner at disney, and iger quickly worked to mend relations with jobs and pixar. on january 24, 2006, jobs and iger announced that disney had agreed to purchase pixar in an all-stock transaction worth $7.4â billion. when the deal closed, jobs became the walt disney company's largest single shareholder with approximately seven percent of the company's stock. jobs's holdings in disney far exceeded those of eisner, who holds 1.7%, and of disney family member roy e. disney, who until his 2009 death held about 1% of the company's stock and whose criticisms of eisnerâespecially that he soured disney's relationship with pixarâaccelerated eisner's ousting. upon completion of the merger, jobs received 7% of disney shares, and joined the board of directors as the largest individual shareholder. upon jobs's death his shares in disney were transferred to the steven p. jobs trust led by laurene jobs.

after jobs's death iger recalled in 2019 that many warned him about jobs, ""that he would bully me and everyone else"". iger wrote, ""who wouldn't want steve jobs to have influence over how a company is run?"", and that as an active disney board member ""he rarely created trouble for me. not never but rarely"". he speculated that they would have seriously considered merging disney and apple had jobs lived. floyd norman, of pixar, described jobs as a ""mature, mellow individual"" who never interfered with the creative process of the filmmakers. in early june 2014, pixar cofounder and walt disney animation studios president ed catmull revealed that jobs once advised him to ""just explain it to them until they understand"" in disagreements. catmull released the book ""creativity, inc."" in 2014, in which he recounts numerous experiences of working with jobs. regarding his own manner of dealing with jobs, catmull writes:

chrisann brennan notes that after jobs was forced out of apple, ""he apologized many times over for his behavior"" towards her and lisa. she also states that jobs ""said that he never took responsibility when he should have, and that he was sorry"". by this time, jobs had developed a strong relationship with lisa and when she was nine, jobs had her name on her birth certificate changed from ""lisa brennan"" to ""lisa brennan-jobs"". in addition, jobs and brennan developed a working relationship to co-parent lisa, a change brennan credits to the influence of his newly found biological sister, mona simpson (who worked to repair the relationship between lisa and jobs). jobs found mona after first finding his birth mother, joanne schieble simpson, shortly after he left apple.

jobs did not contact his birth family during his adoptive mother clara's lifetime, however. he would later tell his official biographer walter isaacson: ""i never wanted [paul and clara] to feel like i didn't consider them my parents, because they were totally my parents [...] i loved them so much that i never wanted them to know of my search, and i even had reporters keep it quiet when any of them found out."" however, in 1986 when he was 31, clara was diagnosed with lung cancer. he began to spend a great deal of time with her and learned more details about her background and his adoption, information that motivated him to find his biological mother. jobs found on his birth certificate the name of the san francisco doctor to whom schieble had turned when she was pregnant. although the doctor did not help jobs while he was alive, he left a letter for jobs to be opened upon his death. as he died soon afterwards, jobs was given the letter which stated that ""his mother had been an unmarried graduate student from wisconsin named joanne schieble"".

jobs only contacted schieble after clara died and after he received permission from his father, paul. in addition, out of respect for paul, he asked the media not to report on his search. jobs stated that he was motivated to find his birth mother out of both curiosity and a need ""to see if she was okay and to thank her, because i'm glad i didn't end up as an abortion. she was twenty-three and she went through a lot to have me."" schieble was emotional during their first meeting (though she wasn't familiar with the history of apple or jobs's role in it) and told him that she had been pressured into signing the adoption papers. she said that she regretted giving him up and repeatedly apologized to him for it. jobs and schieble would develop a friendly relationship throughout the rest of his life and would spend christmas together.

during this first visit, schieble told jobs that he had a sister, mona, who was not aware that she had a brother. schieble then arranged for them to meet in new york where mona worked. her first impression of jobs was that ""he was totally straightforward and lovely, just a normal and sweet guy."" simpson and jobs then went for a long walk to get to know each other. jobs later told his biographer that ""mona was not completely thrilled at first to have me in her life and have her mother so emotionally affectionate toward me . . . . as we got to know each other, we became really good friends, and she is my family. i don't know what i'd do without her. i can't imagine a better sister. my adopted sister, patty, and i were never close.""

jobs then learned his family history. six months after he was given up for adoption, schieble's father died, she wed jandali, and they had a daughter, mona. jandali states that after finishing his phd he returned to syria to work and that it was during this period that schieble left him (they divorced in 1962). he also states that after the divorce he lost contact with mona for a period of time: i also bear the responsibility for being away from my daughter when she was four years old, as her mother divorced me when i went to syria, but we got back in touch after 10 years. we lost touch again when her mother moved and i didn't know where she was, but since 10 years ago we've been in constant contact, and i see her three times a year. i organized a trip for her last year to visit syria and lebanon and she went with a relative from florida. a few years later, schieble married an ice skating teacher, george simpson. mona jandali took her stepfather's last name and thus became mona simpson. in 1970, after they divorced, schieble took mona to los angeles and raised her on her own.

jobs told his official biographer that after meeting simpson, he wanted to become involved in her ongoing search for their father. when he was found working in sacramento, they decided that only simpson would meet him. jandali and simpson spoke for several hours at which point he told her that he had left teaching for the restaurant business. he also said that he and schieble had given another child away for adoption but that ""we'll never see that baby again. that baby's gone."" simpson did not mention that she had met jobs. jandali further told simpson that he once managed a mediterranean restaurant near san jose and that ""all of the successful technology people used to come there. even steve jobs ... oh yeah, he used to come in, and he was a sweet guy and a big tipper."" after hearing about the visit, jobs recalled that ""it was amazing ... i had been to that restaurant a few times, and i remember meeting the owner. he was syrian. balding. we shook hands."" however, jobs did not want to meet jandali because ""i was a wealthy man by then, and i didn't trust him not to try to blackmail me or go to the press about it ... i asked mona not to tell him about me."" jandali later discovered his relationship to jobs through an online blog. he then contacted simpson and asked ""what is this thing about steve jobs?"" simpson told him that it was true and later commented, ""my father is thoughtful and a beautiful storyteller, but he is very, very passive ... he never contacted steve."" because simpson, herself, researched her syrian roots and began to meet members of the family, she assumed that jobs would eventually want to meet their father, but he never did. jobs also never showed an interest in his syrian heritage or the middle east. simpson fictionalized the search for their father in the 1992 novel, ""the lost father"". malek jandali is their cousin.

in 1989, jobs first met his future wife, laurene powell, when he gave a lecture at the stanford graduate school of business, where she was a student. soon after the event, he stated that laurene ""was right there in the front row in the lecture hall, and i couldn't take my eyes off of her ... kept losing my train of thought, and started feeling a little giddy."" after the lecture, jobs met up with her in the parking lot and invited her out to dinner. from that point forward, they were together, with a few minor exceptions, for the rest of his life. powell's father died when she was very young, and her mother raised her in a middle class new jersey home similar to the one jobs grew up in. after she received her ba from the university of pennsylvania, she spent a short period in high finance but found it didn't interest her, so she decided to pursue her mba at stanford instead. in addition, unlike jobs, she was athletic and followed professional sports. she also brought as much self-sufficiency to the relationship as he did and was more of a private than public person. jobs proposed on new year's day 1990 with ""a fistful of freshly picked wildflowers"". they married on march 18, 1991, in a buddhist ceremony at the ahwahnee hotel in yosemite national park. fifty people, including his father, paul, and his sister, mona, attended. the ceremony was conducted by jobs's guru, kobun chino otogawa. the vegan wedding cake was in the shape of yosemite's half dome, and the wedding ended with a hike (during which laurene's brothers had a snowball fight). jobs is reported to have said to mona: ""you see, mona [...], laurene is descended from joe namath, and we're descended from john muir.""

jobs's and powell's first child, reed, was born september 1991. jobs's father, paul, died a year and a half later, on march 5, 1993. jobs and powell had two more children, erin, born in august 1995, and eve, born in 1998. the family lived in palo alto, california. a journalist who grew up locally remembered him as owning the house with ""the scariest [halloween] decorations in palo alto...i don't remember seeing him. i was busy being terrified.""

in 1996, apple announced that it would buy next for $427â million. the deal was finalized in february 1997, bringing jobs back to the company he had cofounded. jobs became ""de facto"" chief after then-ceo gil amelio was ousted in july 1997. he was formally named interim chief executive in september. in march 1998, to concentrate apple's efforts on returning to profitability, jobs terminated a number of projects, such as newton, cyberdog, and opendoc. in the coming months, many employees developed a fear of encountering jobs while riding in the elevator, ""afraid that they might not have a job when the doors opened. the reality was that jobs's summary executions were rare, but a handful of victims was enough to terrorize a whole company."" jobs changed the licensing program for macintosh clones, making it too costly for the manufacturers to continue making machines.

with the purchase of next, much of the company's technology found its way into apple products, most notably nextstep, which evolved into mac os x. under jobs's guidance, the company increased sales significantly with the introduction of the imac and other new products; since then, appealing designs and powerful branding have worked well for apple. at the 2000 macworld expo, jobs officially dropped the ""interim"" modifier from his title at apple and became permanent ceo. jobs quipped at the time that he would be using the title ""iceo"".

the company subsequently branched out, introducing and improving upon other digital appliances. with the introduction of the ipod portable music player, itunes digital music software, and the itunes store, the company made forays into consumer electronics and music distribution. on june 29, 2007, apple entered the cellular phone business with the introduction of the iphone, a multi-touch display cell phone, which also included the features of an ipod and, with its own mobile browser, revolutionized the mobile browsing scene. while nurturing open-ended innovation, jobs also reminded his employees that ""real artists ship"".

jobs had a public war of words with dell computer ceo michael dell, starting in 1987, when jobs first criticized dell for making ""un-innovative beige boxes"". on october 6, 1997, at a gartner symposium, when dell was asked what he would do if he ran the then-troubled apple computer company, he said: ""i'd shut it down and give the money back to the shareholders."" then, in 2006, jobs sent an email to all employees when apple's market capitalization rose above dell's:

jobs was both admired and criticized for his consummate skill at persuasion and salesmanship, which has been dubbed the ""reality distortion field"" and was particularly evident during his keynote speeches (colloquially known as ""stevenotes"") at macworld expos and at apple worldwide developers conferences.

jobs was a board member at gap inc. from 1999 to 2002.
in 2001, jobs was granted stock options in the amount of 7.5â million shares of apple with an exercise price of $18.30. it was alleged that the options had been backdated, and that the exercise price should have been $21.10. it was further alleged that jobs had thereby incurred taxable income of $20,000,000 that he did not report, and that apple overstated its earnings by that same amount. as a result, jobs potentially faced a number of criminal charges and civil penalties. the case was the subject of active criminal and civil government investigations, though an independent internal apple investigation completed on december 29, 2006 found that jobs was unaware of these issues and that the options granted to him were returned without being exercised in 2003.

in 2005, jobs responded to criticism of apple's poor recycling programs for e-waste in the us by lashing out at environmental and other advocates at apple's annual meeting in cupertino in april. a few weeks later, apple announced it would take back ipods for free at its retail stores. the computer takeback campaign responded by flying a banner from a plane over the stanford university graduation at which jobs was the commencement speaker. the banner read ""steve, don't be a mini-playerârecycle all e-waste.""

in 2006, he further expanded apple's recycling programs to any us customer who buys a new mac. this program includes shipping and ""environmentally friendly disposal"" of their old systems. the success of apple's unique products and services provided several years of stable financial returns, propelling apple to become the world's most valuable publicly traded company in 2011.

jobs was perceived as a demanding perfectionist who always aspired to position his businesses and their products at the forefront of the information technology industry by foreseeing and setting innovation and style trends. he summed up this self-concept at the end of his keynote speech at the macworld conference and expo in january 2007, by quoting ice hockey player wayne gretzky:

on july 1, 2008, a billion class action suit was filed against several members of the apple board of directors for revenue lost because of alleged securities fraud.

in a 2011 interview with biographer walter isaacson, jobs revealed that he had met with us president barack obama, complained about the nation's shortage of software engineers, and told obama that he was ""headed for a one-term presidency"". jobs proposed that any foreign student who got an engineering degree at a us university should automatically be offered a green card. after the meeting, jobs commented, ""the president is very smart, but he kept explaining to us reasons why things can't get done . . . . it infuriates me.""

in october 2003, jobs was diagnosed with cancer. in mid-2004, he announced to his employees that he had a cancerous tumor in his pancreas. the prognosis for pancreatic cancer is usually very poor; jobs stated that he had a rare, much less aggressive type, known as islet cell neuroendocrine tumor.

despite his diagnosis, jobs resisted his doctors' recommendations for medical intervention for nine months, instead relying on alternative medicine to thwart the disease. according to harvard researcher ramzi amri, his choice of alternative treatment ""led to an unnecessarily early death"". other doctors agree that jobs's diet was insufficient to address his disease. however, cancer researcher and alternative medicine critic david gorski wrote that ""it's impossible to know whether and by how much he might have decreased his chances of surviving his cancer through his flirtation with woo. my best guess was that jobs probably only modestly decreased his chances of survival, if that."" barrie r. cassileth, the chief of memorial sloan kettering cancer center's integrative medicine department, said, ""jobs's faith in alternative medicine likely cost him his life... he had the only kind of pancreatic cancer that is treatable and curable... he essentially committed suicide."" according to jobs's biographer, walter isaacson, ""for nine months he refused to undergo surgery for his pancreatic cancer â a decision he later regretted as his health declined"". ""instead, he tried a vegan diet, acupuncture, herbal remedies, and other treatments he found online, and even consulted a psychic. he was also influenced by a doctor who ran a clinic that advised juice fasts, bowel cleansings and other unproven approaches, before finally having surgery in july 2004."" he eventually underwent a pancreaticoduodenectomy (or ""whipple procedure"") in july 2004, that appeared to remove the tumor successfully. jobs did not receive chemotherapy or radiation therapy. during jobs's absence, tim cook, head of worldwide sales and operations at apple, ran the company.

two years later, similar concerns followed jobs's 2008 wwdc keynote address. apple officials stated that jobs was victim to a ""common bug"" and was taking antibiotics, while others surmised his cachectic appearance was due to the whipple procedure. during a july conference call discussing apple earnings, participants responded to repeated questions about jobs's health by insisting that it was a ""private matter"". others said that shareholders had a right to know more, given jobs's hands-on approach to running his company. based on an off-the-record phone conversation with jobs, ""the new york times"" reported, ""while his health problems amounted to a good deal more than 'a common bug', they weren't life-threatening and he doesn't have a recurrence of cancer.""

on august 28, 2008, bloomberg mistakenly published a 2500-word obituary of jobs in its corporate news service, containing blank spaces for his age and cause of death. news carriers customarily stockpile up-to-date obituaries to facilitate news delivery in the event of a well-known figure's death. although the error was promptly rectified, many news carriers and blogs reported on it, intensifying rumors concerning jobs's health. jobs responded at apple's september 2008 ""let's rock"" keynote by paraphrasing mark twain: ""reports of my death are greatly exaggerated."" at a subsequent media event, jobs concluded his presentation with a slide reading ""110/70"", referring to his blood pressure, stating he would not address further questions about his health.

on december 16, 2008, apple announced that marketing vice-president phil schiller would deliver the company's final keynote address at the macworld conference and expo 2009, again reviving questions about jobs's health. in a statement given on january 5, 2009, on apple.com, jobs said that he had been suffering from a ""hormone imbalance"" for several months.

on january 14, 2009, jobs wrote in an internal apple memo that in the previous week he had ""learned that my health-related issues are more complex than i originally thought"". he announced a six-month leave of absence until the end of june 2009, to allow him to better focus on his health. tim cook, who previously acted as ceo in jobs's 2004 absence, became acting ceo of apple, with jobs still involved with ""major strategic decisions"".

in 2009, tim cook offered a portion of his liver to jobs, since both share a rare blood type and the donor liver can regenerate tissue after such an operation. jobs yelled, ""i'll never let you do that. i'll never do that.""

in april 2009, jobs underwent a liver transplant at methodist university hospital transplant institute in memphis, tennessee. jobs's prognosis was described as ""excellent"".

on january 17, 2011, a year and a half after jobs returned to work following the liver transplant, apple announced that he had been granted a medical leave of absence. jobs announced his leave in a letter to employees, stating his decision was made ""so he could focus on his health"". as it did at the time of his 2009 medical leave, apple announced that tim cook would run day-to-day operations and that jobs would continue to be involved in major strategic decisions at the company. while on leave, jobs appeared at the ipad 2 launch event on march 2, the wwdc keynote introducing icloud on june 6, and before the cupertino city council on june 7.

on august 24, 2011, jobs announced his resignation as apple's ceo, writing to the board, ""i have always said if there ever came a day when i could no longer meet my duties and expectations as apple's ceo, i would be the first to let you know. unfortunately, that day has come."" jobs became chairman of the board and named tim cook as his successor as ceo. jobs continued to work for apple until the day before his death six weeks later.

jobs died at his palo alto, california, home around 3â p.m. (pdt) on october 5, 2011, due to complications from a relapse of his previously treated islet-cell pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor, which resulted in respiratory arrest. he had lost consciousness the day before and died with his wife, children, and sisters at his side. his sister, mona simpson, described his death thus: ""steve's final words, hours earlier, were monosyllables, repeated three times. before embarking, he'd looked at his sister patty, then for a long time at his children, then at his life's partner, laurene, and then over their shoulders past them. steve's final words were: 'oh wow. oh wow. oh wow.'"" he then lost consciousness and died several hours later. a small private funeral was held on october 7, 2011, the details of which, out of respect for jobs's family, were not made public.

apple and pixar each issued announcements of his death. apple announced on the same day that they had no plans for a public service, but were encouraging ""well-wishers"" to send their remembrance messages to an email address created to receive such messages. apple and microsoft both flew their flags at half-staff throughout their respective headquarters and campuses.

bob iger ordered all disney properties, including walt disney world and disneyland, to fly their flags at half-staff from october 6 to 12, 2011. for two weeks following his death, apple displayed on its corporate web site a simple page that showed jobs's name and lifespan next to his grayscale portrait. on october 19, 2011, apple employees held a private memorial service for jobs on the apple campus in cupertino. jobs's widow, laurene, was in attendance, as well as cook, bill campbell, norah jones, al gore, and coldplay. some of apple's retail stores closed briefly so employees could attend the memorial. a video of the service was uploaded to apple's website.

california governor jerry brown declared sunday, october 16, 2011, to be ""steve jobs day"". on that day, an invitation-only memorial was held at stanford university. those in attendance included apple and other tech company executives, members of the media, celebrities, close friends of jobs, and politicians, along with jobs's family. bono, yo yo ma, and joan baez performed at the service, which lasted longer than an hour. the service was highly secured, with guards at all of the university's gates, and a helicopter flying overhead from an area news station. each attendee was given a small brown box as a ""farewell gift"" from jobs. the box contained a copy of the ""autobiography of a yogi"" by paramahansa yogananda.

apple co-founder steve wozniak, former owner of what would become pixar, george lucas,<ref name=""http://postcards.blogs.fortune.cnn.com/2011/10/06/george-lucas-steve-jobs/""></ref> former rival, microsoft co-founder bill gates, and president barack obama all offered statements in response to his death.

jobs is buried in an unmarked grave at alta mesa memorial park, the only nonsectarian cemetery in palo alto.

steve jobs is the subject of a number of books and films.

lisa brennan-jobs, jobs's eldest daughter, described jobs in her memoir as sexually inappropriate and described patterns of cruel behavior by him during her adolescent years.

jobs's design aesthetic was influenced by philosophies of zen and buddhism. in india, he experienced buddhism while on his seven-month spiritual journey, and his sense of intuition was influenced by the spiritual people with whom he studied. he also learned from many references and sources, such as modernist architectural style of joseph eichler, and the industrial designs of richard sapper and dieter rams.

according to apple co-founder steve wozniak, ""steve didn't ever code. he wasn't an engineer and he didn't do any original design..."" daniel kottke, one of apple's earliest employees and a college friend of jobs's, stated that ""between woz and jobs, woz was the innovator, the inventor. steve jobs was the marketing person.""

he is listed as either primary inventor or co-inventor in 346 united states patents or patent applications related to a range of technologies from actual computer and portable devices to user interfaces (including touch-based), speakers, keyboards, power adapters, staircases, clasps, sleeves, lanyards and packages. jobs's contributions to most of his patents were to ""the look and feel of the product"". his industrial design chief jonathan ive had his name along with him for 200 of the patents. most of these are design patents (specific product designs; for example, jobs listed as primary inventor in patents for both original and lamp-style imacs, as well as powerbook g4 titanium) as opposed to utility patents (inventions). he has 43 issued us patents on inventions. the patent on the mac os x dock user interface with ""magnification"" feature was issued the day before he died. although jobs had little involvement in the engineering and technical side of the original apple computers, jobs later used his ceo position to directly involve himself with product design.

involved in many projects throughout his career was his long-time marketing executive and confidant joanna hoffman, known as one of the few employees at apple and next who could successfully stand up to jobs while also engaging with him.

even while terminally ill in the hospital, jobs sketched new devices that would hold the ipad in a hospital bed. he also despised the oxygen monitor on his finger and suggested ways to revise the design for simplicity.

since his death, the former apple ceo has won 141 patents, more than most inventors win during their lifetimes. currently, jobs holds over 450 patents.

the apple ii is an 8-bit home computer, one of the world's first highly successful mass-produced microcomputer products, designed primarily by steve wozniak (jobs oversaw the development of the apple ii's unusual case and rod holt developed the unique power supply). it was introduced in 1977 at the west coast computer faire by jobs and wozniak and was the first consumer product sold by apple computer.

the lisa is a personal computer designed by apple during the early 1980s. it was the first personal computer to offer a graphical user interface in a machine aimed at individual business users. development of the lisa began in 1978. the lisa sold poorly, with only 100,000 units sold.

in 1982, after jobs was forced out of the lisa project, he joined the macintosh project. the macintosh is not a direct descendant of lisa, although there are obvious similarities between the systems. the final revision, the lisa 2/10, was modified and sold as the macintosh xl.

once he joined the original macintosh team, jobs took over the project after wozniak had experienced a traumatic airplane accident and temporarily left the company. jobs introduced the macintosh computer on january 24, 1984. this was the first mass-market personal computer featuring an integral graphical user interface and mouse. this first model was later renamed to ""macintosh 128k"" for uniqueness amongst a populous family of subsequently updated models which are also based on apple's same proprietary architecture. since 1998, apple has largely phased out the macintosh name in favor of ""mac"", though the product family has been nicknamed ""mac"" or ""the mac"" since the development of the first model. the macintosh was introduced by a us$1.5â million ridley scott television commercial, ""1984"". it most notably aired during the third quarter of super bowl xviii on january 22, 1984, and some people consider the ad a ""watershed event"" and a ""masterpiece"". regis mckenna called the ad ""more successful than the mac itself"". ""1984"" uses an unnamed heroine to represent the coming of the macintosh (indicated by a picasso-style picture of the computer on her white tank top) as a means of saving humanity from the conformity of ibm's attempts to dominate the computer industry. the ad alludes to george orwell's novel, ""nineteen eighty-four"", which describes a dystopian future ruled by a televised ""big brother.""

the macintosh, however, was expensive, which hindered its ability to be competitive in a market already dominated by the commodore 64 for consumers, as well as the ibm personal computer and its accompanying clone market for businesses. macintosh systems still found success in education and desktop publishing and kept apple as the second-largest pc manufacturer for the next decade.

after jobs was forced out of apple in 1985, he started a company that built workstation computers. the next computer was introduced in 1988 at a lavish launch event. tim berners-lee created the world's first web browser (worldwideweb) using the next computer. the next computer's operating system, named nextstep, was the basis for darwin, the kernel for the operating system on most of apple's products (namely, macos, ios, watchos, and audioos)

apple imac was introduced in 1998 and its innovative design was directly the result of jobs's return to apple. apple boasted ""the back of our computer looks better than the front of anyone else's."" described as ""cartoonlike"", the first imac, clad in bondi blue plastic, was unlike any personal computer that came before. in 1999, apple introduced the graphite gray apple imac and since has varied the shape, colour and size considerably while maintaining the all-in-one design. design ideas were intended to create a connection with the user such as the handle and a breathing light effect when the computer went to sleep. the apple imac sold for $1,299 at that time. the imac also featured forward-thinking changes, such as eschewing the floppy disk drive and moving exclusively to usb for connecting peripherals. this latter change resulted, through the imac's success, in the interface being popularised among third-party peripheral makersâas evidenced by the fact that many early usb peripherals were made of translucent plastic (to match the imac design).

itunes is a media player, media library, online radio broadcaster, and mobile device management application developed by apple. it is used to play, download, and organize digital audio and video (as well as other types of media available on the itunes store) on personal computers running the macos and microsoft windows operating systems. the itunes store is also available on the ipod touch, iphone, and ipad.

through the itunes store, users can purchase and download music, music videos, television shows, audiobooks, podcasts, movies, and movie rentals in some countries, and ringtones, available on the iphone and ipod touch (fourth generation onward). application software for the iphone, ipad and ipod touch can be downloaded from the app store.

the first generation of ipod was released october 23, 2001. the major innovation of the ipod was its small size achieved by using a 1.8"" hard drive compared to the 2.5"" drives common to players at that time. the capacity of the first generation ipod ranged from 5â gb to 10â gb. the ipod sold for us$399 and more than 100,000 ipods were sold before the end of 2001. the introduction of the ipod resulted in apple becoming a major player in the music industry. also, the ipod's success prepared the way for the itunes music store and the iphone. after the 1st generation of ipod, apple released the hard drive-based ipod classic, the touchscreen ipod touch, the video-capable ipod nano, and the screenless ipod shuffle in the following years.

apple began work on the first iphone in 2005 and the first iphone was released on june 29, 2007. the iphone created such a sensation that a survey indicated six out of ten americans were aware of its release. ""time"" declared it ""invention of the year"" for 2007. the completed iphone had multimedia capabilities and functioned as a quad-band touch screen smartphone. a year later, the iphone 3g was released in july 2008 with three key features: support for gps, 3g data and tri-band umts/hsdpa. in june 2009, the iphone 3gs, whose improvements included voice control, a better camera, and a faster processor, was introduced by phil schiller. the iphone 4 is thinner than previous models, has a five megapixel camera capable of recording video in 720p hd, and adds a secondary front-facing camera for video calls. a major feature of the iphone 4s, introduced in october 2011, was siri, a virtual assistant capable of voice recognition.

ipad is an ios-based line of tablet computers designed and marketed by apple. the first ipad was released on april 3, 2010; the most recent ipad models, the ipad (2017), ipad pro, and ipad mini 4, were released on september 9, 2015, and march 24, 2017. the user interface is built around the device's multi-touch screen, including a virtual keyboard. the ipad includes built-in wi-fi and cellular connectivity on select models. , more than 250 million ipads have been sold.
"
charles darwin,"
charles robert darwin, (; 12 february 1809â â 19 april 1882) was an english naturalist, geologist and biologist, best known for his contributions to the science of evolution. his proposition that all species of life have descended over time from common ancestors is now widely accepted, and considered a foundational concept in science. in a joint publication with alfred russel wallace, he introduced his scientific theory that this branching pattern of evolution resulted from a process that he called natural selection, in which the struggle for existence has a similar effect to the artificial selection involved in selective breeding. darwin has been described as one of the most influential figures in human history, and he was honoured by burial in westminster abbey.

darwin published his theory of evolution with compelling evidence in his 1859 book ""on the origin of species"". by the 1870s, the scientific community and a majority of the educated public had accepted evolution as a fact. however, many favoured competing explanations which gave only a minor role to natural selection, and it was not until the emergence of the modern evolutionary synthesis from the 1930s to the 1950s that a broad consensus developed in which natural selection was the basic mechanism of evolution. darwin's scientific discovery is the unifying theory of the life sciences, explaining the diversity of life.

darwin's early interest in nature led him to neglect his medical education at the university of edinburgh; instead, he helped to investigate marine invertebrates. studies at the university of cambridge (christ's college) encouraged his passion for natural science. his five-year voyage on established him as an eminent geologist whose observations and theories supported charles lyell's conception of gradual geological change, and publication of his journal of the voyage made him famous as a popular author.

puzzled by the geographical distribution of wildlife and fossils he collected on the voyage, darwin began detailed investigations, and in 1838 conceived his theory of natural selection. although he discussed his ideas with several naturalists, he needed time for extensive research and his geological work had priority. he was writing up his theory in 1858 when alfred russel wallace sent him an essay that described the same idea, prompting immediate joint publication of both of their theories. darwin's work established evolutionary descent with modification as the dominant scientific explanation of diversification in nature. in 1871 he examined human evolution and sexual selection in ""the descent of man, and selection in relation to sex"", followed by ""the expression of the emotions in man and animals"" (1872). his research on plants was published in a series of books, and in his final book, ""the formation of vegetable mould, through the actions of worms"" (1881), he examined earthworms and their effect on soil.

charles robert darwin was born in shrewsbury, shropshire, on 12 february 1809, at his family's home, the mount. he was the fifth of six children of wealthy society doctor and financier robert darwin and susannah darwin (""nã©e"" wedgwood). his grandfathers erasmus darwin and josiah wedgwood were both prominent abolitionists.
both families were largely unitarian, though the wedgwoods were adopting anglicanism. robert darwin, himself quietly a freethinker, had baby charles baptised in november 1809 in the anglican st chad's church, shrewsbury, but charles and his siblings attended the unitarian chapel with their mother. the eight-year-old charles already had a taste for natural history and collecting when he joined the day school run by its preacher in 1817. that july, his mother died. from september 1818, he joined his older brother erasmus attending the nearby anglican shrewsbury school as a boarder.

darwin spent the summer of 1825 as an apprentice doctor, helping his father treat the poor of shropshire, before going to the university of edinburgh medical school (at the time the best medical school in the uk) with his brother erasmus in october 1825. darwin found lectures dull and surgery distressing, so he neglected his studies. he learned taxidermy in around 40 daily hour-long sessions from john edmonstone, a freed black slave who had accompanied charles waterton in the south american rainforest.

in darwin's second year at the university he joined the plinian society, a student natural-history group featuring lively debates in which radical democratic students with materialistic views challenged orthodox religious concepts of science. he assisted robert edmond grant's investigations of the anatomy and life cycle of marine invertebrates in the firth of forth, and on 27 march 1827 presented at the plinian his own discovery that black spores found in oyster shells were the eggs of a skate leech. one day, grant praised lamarck's evolutionary ideas. darwin was astonished by grant's audacity, but had recently read similar ideas in his grandfather erasmus' journals. darwin was rather bored by robert jameson's natural-history course, which covered geologyâincluding the debate between neptunism and plutonism. he learned the classification of plants, and assisted with work on the collections of the university museum, one of the largest museums in europe at the time.

darwin's neglect of medical studies annoyed his father, who shrewdly sent him to christ's college, cambridge, to study for a bachelor of arts degree as the first step towards becoming an anglican country parson. as darwin was unqualified for the ""tripos"", he joined the ""ordinary"" degree course in january 1828. he preferred riding and shooting to studying. his cousin william darwin fox introduced him to the popular craze for beetle collecting; darwin pursued this zealously, getting some of his finds published in james francis stephens' ""illustrations of british entomology"". he became a close friend and follower of botany professor john stevens henslow and met other leading parson-naturalists who saw scientific work as religious natural theology, becoming known to these dons as ""the man who walks with henslow"". when his own exams drew near, darwin applied himself to his studies and was delighted by the language and logic of william paley's ""evidences of christianity"" (1794). in his final examination in january 1831 darwin did well, coming tenth out of 178 candidates for the ""ordinary"" degree.

darwin had to stay at cambridge until june 1831. he studied paley's ""natural theology or evidences of the existence and attributes of the deity"" (first published in 1802), which made an argument for divine design in nature, explaining adaptation as god acting through laws of nature. he read john herschel's new book, ""preliminary discourse on the study of natural philosophy"" (1831), which described the highest aim of natural philosophy as understanding such laws through inductive reasoning based on observation, and alexander von humboldt's ""personal narrative"" of scientific travels in 1799â1804. inspired with ""a burning zeal"" to contribute, darwin planned to visit tenerife with some classmates after graduation to study natural history in the tropics. in preparation, he joined adam sedgwick's geology course, then on 4 august travelled with him to spend a fortnight mapping strata in wales.

after leaving sedgwick in wales, darwin spent a week with student friends at barmouth, then returned home on 29 august to find a letter from henslow proposing him as a suitable (if unfinished) naturalist for a self-funded supernumerary place on with captain robert fitzroy, emphasising that this was a position for a gentleman rather than ""a mere collector"". the ship was to leave in four weeks on an expedition to chart the coastline of south america. robert darwin objected to his son's planned two-year voyage, regarding it as a waste of time, but was persuaded by his brother-in-law, josiah wedgwood ii, to agree to (and fund) his son's participation. darwin took care to remain in a private capacity to retain control over his collection, intending it for a major scientific institution.

after delays, the voyage began on 27 december 1831; it lasted almost five years. as fitzroy had intended, darwin spent most of that time on land investigating geology and making natural history collections, while hms ""beagle"" surveyed and charted coasts. he kept careful notes of his observations and theoretical speculations, and at intervals during the voyage his specimens were sent to cambridge together with letters including a copy of his journal for his family. he had some expertise in geology, beetle collecting and dissecting marine invertebrates, but in all other areas was a novice and ably collected specimens for expert appraisal. despite suffering badly from seasickness, darwin wrote copious notes while on board the ship. most of his zoology notes are about marine invertebrates, starting with plankton collected in a calm spell.

on their first stop ashore at st jago in cape verde, darwin found that a white band high in the volcanic rock cliffs included seashells. fitzroy had given him the first volume of charles lyell's ""principles of geology"", which set out uniformitarian concepts of land slowly rising or falling over immense periods, and darwin saw things lyell's way, theorising and thinking of writing a book on geology.
when they reached brazil, darwin was delighted by the tropical forest, but detested the sight of slavery, and disputed this issue with fitzroy.

the survey continued to the south in patagonia. they stopped at bahã­a blanca, and in cliffs near punta alta darwin made a major find of fossil bones of huge extinct mammals beside modern seashells, indicating recent extinction with no signs of change in climate or catastrophe. he identified the little-known ""megatherium"" by a tooth and its association with bony armour, which had at first seemed to him to be like a giant version of the armour on local armadillos. the finds brought great interest when they reached england.

on rides with gauchos into the interior to explore geology and collect more fossils, darwin gained social, political and anthropological insights into both native and colonial people at a time of revolution, and learnt that two types of rhea had separate but overlapping territories. further south, he saw stepped plains of shingle and seashells as raised beaches showing a series of elevations. he read lyell's second volume and accepted its view of ""centres of creation"" of species, but his discoveries and theorising challenged lyell's ideas of smooth continuity and of extinction of species.
three fuegians on board had been seized during the first ""beagle"" voyage, then during a year in england were educated as missionaries. darwin found them friendly and civilised, yet at tierra del fuego he met ""miserable, degraded savages"", as different as wild from domesticated animals. he remained convinced that, despite this diversity, all humans were interrelated with a shared origin and potential for improvement towards civilisation. unlike his scientist friends, he now thought there was no unbridgeable gap between humans and animals. a year on, the mission had been abandoned. the fuegian they had named jemmy button lived like the other natives, had a wife, and had no wish to return to england.

darwin experienced an earthquake in chile in 1835 and saw signs that the land had just been raised, including mussel-beds stranded above high tide. high in the andes he saw seashells, and several fossil trees that had grown on a sand beach. he theorised that as the land rose, oceanic islands sank, and coral reefs round them grew to form atolls.

on the geologically new galã¡pagos islands, darwin looked for evidence attaching wildlife to an older ""centre of creation"", and found mockingbirds allied to those in chile but differing from island to island. he heard that slight variations in the shape of tortoise shells showed which island they came from, but failed to collect them, even after eating tortoises taken on board as food. in australia, the marsupial rat-kangaroo and the platypus seemed so unusual that darwin thought it was almost as though two distinct creators had been at work. he found the aborigines ""good-humoured & pleasant"", and noted their depletion by european settlement.

fitzroy investigated how the atolls of the cocos (keeling) islands had formed, and the survey supported darwin's theorising. fitzroy began writing the official ""narrative"" of the ""beagle"" voyages, and after reading darwin's diary he proposed incorporating it into the account. darwin's ""journal"" was eventually rewritten as a separate third volume, on natural history.

in cape town, south africa, darwin and fitzroy met john herschel, who had recently written to lyell praising his uniformitarianism as opening bold speculation on ""that mystery of mysteries, the replacement of extinct species by others"" as ""a natural in contradistinction to a miraculous process"".
when organising his notes as the ship sailed home, darwin wrote that, if his growing suspicions about the mockingbirds, the tortoises and the falkland islands fox were correct, ""such facts undermine the stability of species"", then cautiously added ""would"" before ""undermine"". he later wrote that such facts ""seemed to me to throw some light on the origin of species"".

by the time darwin returned to england, he was already a celebrity in scientific circles as in december 1835 henslow had fostered his former pupil's reputation by giving selected naturalists a pamphlet of darwin's geological letters. on 2 october 1836 the ship anchored at falmouth, cornwall. darwin promptly made the long coach journey to shrewsbury to visit his home and see relatives. he then hurried to cambridge to see henslow, who advised him on finding naturalists available to catalogue darwin's animal collections and who agreed to take on the botanical specimens. darwin's father organised investments, enabling his son to be a self-funded gentleman scientist, and an excited darwin went round the london institutions being fãªted and seeking experts to describe the collections. british zoologists at the time had a huge backlog of work due to natural history collecting being promoted and encouraged through the british empire, and there was a danger of specimens just being left in storage.

charles lyell eagerly met darwin for the first time on 29 october and soon introduced him to the up-and-coming anatomist richard owen, who had the facilities of the royal college of surgeons to work on the fossil bones collected by darwin. owen's surprising results included other gigantic extinct ground sloths as well as the ""megatherium"", a near complete skeleton of the unknown ""scelidotherium"" and a hippopotamus-sized rodent-like skull named ""toxodon"" resembling a giant capybara. the armour fragments were actually from ""glyptodon"", a huge armadillo-like creature as darwin had initially thought. these extinct creatures were related to living species in south america.

in mid-december, darwin took lodgings in cambridge to organise work on his collections and rewrite his ""journal"". he wrote his first paper, showing that the south american landmass was slowly rising, and with lyell's enthusiastic backing read it to the geological society of london on 4 january 1837. on the same day, he presented his mammal and bird specimens to the zoological society. the ornithologist john gould soon announced that the galapagos birds that darwin had thought a mixture of blackbirds, ""gros-beaks"" and finches, were, in fact, twelve separate species of finches. on 17 february, darwin was elected to the council of the geological society, and lyell's presidential address presented owen's findings on darwin's fossils, stressing geographical continuity of species as supporting his uniformitarian ideas.

early in march, darwin moved to london to be near this work, joining lyell's social circle of scientists and experts such as charles babbage, who described god as a programmer of laws. darwin stayed with his freethinking brother erasmus, part of this whig circle and a close friend of the writer harriet martineau, who promoted malthusianism underlying the controversial whig poor law reforms to stop welfare from causing overpopulation and more poverty. as a unitarian, she welcomed the radical implications of transmutation of species, promoted by grant and younger surgeons influenced by geoffroy. transmutation was anathema to anglicans defending social order, but reputable scientists openly discussed the subject and there was wide interest in john herschel's letter praising lyell's approach as a way to find a natural cause of the origin of new species.

gould met darwin and told him that the galã¡pagos mockingbirds from different islands were separate species, not just varieties, and what darwin had thought was a ""wren"" was also in the finch group. darwin had not labelled the finches by island, but from the notes of others on the ship, including fitzroy, he allocated species to islands. the two rheas were also distinct species, and on 14 march darwin announced how their distribution changed going southwards.
by mid-march 1837, barely six months after his return to england, darwin was speculating in his ""red notebook"" on the possibility that ""one species does change into another"" to explain the geographical distribution of living species such as the rheas, and extinct ones such as the strange extinct mammal ""macrauchenia"", which resembled a giant guanaco, a llama relative. his thoughts on lifespan, asexual reproduction and sexual reproduction developed in his ""b"" notebook around mid-july on to variation in offspring ""to adapt & alter the race to ""changing"" world"" explaining the galã¡pagos tortoises, mockingbirds and rheas. he sketched branching descent, then a genealogical branching of a single evolutionary tree, in which ""it is absurd to talk of one animal being higher than another"", discarding lamarck's independent lineages progressing to higher forms.

while developing this intensive study of transmutation, darwin became mired in more work. still rewriting his ""journal"", he took on editing and publishing the expert reports on his collections, and with henslow's help obtained a treasury grant of â£1,000 to sponsor this multi-volume ""zoology of the voyage of h.m.s. beagle"", a sum equivalent to about â£ in 2017. he stretched the funding to include his planned books on geology, and agreed to unrealistic dates with the publisher. as the victorian era began, darwin pressed on with writing his ""journal"", and in august 1837 began correcting printer's proofs.

as darwin worked under pressure, his health suffered. on 20 september he had ""an uncomfortable palpitation of the heart"", so his doctors urged him to ""knock off all work"" and live in the country for a few weeks. after visiting shrewsbury he joined his wedgwood relatives at maer hall, staffordshire, but found them too eager for tales of his travels to give him much rest. his charming, intelligent, and cultured cousin emma wedgwood, nine months older than darwin, was nursing his invalid aunt. his uncle josiah pointed out an area of ground where cinders had disappeared under loam and suggested that this might have been the work of earthworms, inspiring ""a new & important theory"" on their role in soil formation, which darwin presented at the geological society on 1 november 1837.

william whewell pushed darwin to take on the duties of secretary of the geological society. after initially declining the work, he accepted the post in march 1838. despite the grind of writing and editing the ""beagle"" reports, darwin made remarkable progress on transmutation, taking every opportunity to question expert naturalists and, unconventionally, people with practical experience in selective breeding such as farmers and pigeon fanciers. over time, his research drew on information from his relatives and children, the family butler, neighbours, colonists and former shipmates. he included mankind in his speculations from the outset, and on seeing an orangutan in the zoo on 28 march 1838 noted its childlike behaviour.
the strain took a toll, and by june he was being laid up for days on end with stomach problems, headaches and heart symptoms. for the rest of his life, he was repeatedly incapacitated with episodes of stomach pains, vomiting, severe boils, palpitations, trembling and other symptoms, particularly during times of stress, such as attending meetings or making social visits. the cause of darwin's illness remained unknown, and attempts at treatment had only ephemeral success.

on 23 june, he took a break and went ""geologising"" in scotland. he visited glen roy in glorious weather to see the parallel ""roads"" cut into the hillsides at three heights. he later published his view that these were marine raised beaches, but then had to accept that they were shorelines of a proglacial lake.

fully recuperated, he returned to shrewsbury in july. used to jotting down daily notes on animal breeding, he scrawled rambling thoughts about marriage, career and prospects on two scraps of paper, one with columns headed """"marry"""" and """"not marry"""". advantages under ""marry"" included ""constant companion and a friend in old ageâ ... better than a dog anyhow"", against points such as ""less money for books"" and ""terrible loss of time."" having decided in favour of marriage, he discussed it with his father, then went to visit his cousin emma on 29 july. he did not get around to proposing, but against his father's advice he mentioned his ideas on transmutation.

continuing his research in london, darwin's wide reading now included the sixth edition of malthus's ""an essay on the principle of population"", and on 28 september 1838 he noted its assertion that human ""population, when unchecked, goes on doubling itself every twenty five years, or increases in a geometrical ratio"", a geometric progression so that population soon exceeds food supply in what is known as a malthusian catastrophe. darwin was well prepared to compare this to de candolle's ""warring of the species"" of plants and the struggle for existence among wildlife, explaining how numbers of a species kept roughly stable. as species always breed beyond available resources, favourable variations would make organisms better at surviving and passing the variations on to their offspring, while unfavourable variations would be lost. he wrote that the ""final cause of all this wedging, must be to sort out proper structure, & adapt it to changes"", so that ""one may say there is a force like a hundred thousand wedges trying force into every kind of adapted structure into the gaps of in the economy of nature, or rather forming gaps by thrusting out weaker ones."" this would result in the formation of new species. as he later wrote in his ""autobiography"":

by mid december, darwin saw a similarity between farmers picking the best stock in selective breeding, and a malthusian nature selecting from chance variants so that ""every part of newly acquired structure is fully practical and perfected"", thinking this comparison ""a beautiful part of my theory"". he later called his theory natural selection, an analogy with what he termed the ""artificial selection"" of selective breeding.

on 11 november, he returned to maer and proposed to emma, once more telling her his ideas. she accepted, then in exchanges of loving letters she showed how she valued his openness in sharing their differences, also expressing her strong unitarian beliefs and concerns that his honest doubts might separate them in the afterlife. while he was house-hunting in london, bouts of illness continued and emma wrote urging him to get some rest, almost prophetically remarking ""so don't be ill any more my dear charley till i can be with you to nurse you."" he found what they called ""macaw cottage"" (because of its gaudy interiors) in gower street, then moved his ""museum"" in over christmas. on 24 january 1839, darwin was elected a fellow of the royal society (frs).

on 29 january, darwin and emma wedgwood were married at maer in an anglican ceremony arranged to suit the unitarians, then immediately caught the train to london and their new home.

darwin now had the framework of his theory of natural selection ""by which to work"", as his ""prime hobby"". his research included extensive experimental selective breeding of plants and animals, finding evidence that species were not fixed and investigating many detailed ideas to refine and substantiate his theory. for fifteen years this work was in the background to his main occupation of writing on geology and publishing expert reports on the ""beagle"" collections, and in particular, the barnacles.

when fitzroy's ""narrative"" was published in may 1839, darwin's ""journal and remarks"" was such a success as the third volume that later that year it was published on its own. early in 1842, darwin wrote about his ideas to charles lyell, who noted that his ally ""denies seeing a beginning to each crop of species"".

darwin's book ""the structure and distribution of coral reefs"" on his theory of atoll formation was published in may 1842 after more than three years of work, and he then wrote his first ""pencil sketch"" of his theory of natural selection. to escape the pressures of london, the family moved to rural down house in september. on 11 january 1844, darwin mentioned his theorising to the botanist joseph dalton hooker, writing with melodramatic humour ""it is like confessing a murder"". hooker replied ""there may in my opinion have been a series of productions on different spots, & also a gradual change of species. i shall be delighted to hear how you think that this change may have taken place, as no presently conceived opinions satisfy me on the subject.""

by july, darwin had expanded his ""sketch"" into a 230-page ""essay"", to be expanded with his research results if he died prematurely. in november, the anonymously published sensational best-seller ""vestiges of the natural history of creation"" brought wide interest in transmutation. darwin scorned its amateurish geology and zoology, but carefully reviewed his own arguments. controversy erupted, and it continued to sell well despite contemptuous dismissal by scientists.

darwin completed his third geological book in 1846. he now renewed a fascination and expertise in marine invertebrates, dating back to his student days with grant, by dissecting and classifying the barnacles he had collected on the voyage, enjoying observing beautiful structures and thinking about comparisons with allied structures. in 1847, hooker read the ""essay"" and sent notes that provided darwin with the calm critical feedback that he needed, but would not commit himself and questioned darwin's opposition to continuing acts of creation.

in an attempt to improve his chronic ill health, darwin went in 1849 to dr. james gully's malvern spa and was surprised to find some benefit from hydrotherapy. then, in 1851, his treasured daughter annie fell ill, reawakening his fears that his illness might be hereditary, and after a long series of crises she died.

in eight years of work on barnacles (cirripedia), darwin's theory helped him to find ""homologies"" showing that slightly changed body parts served different functions to meet new conditions, and in some genera he found minute males parasitic on hermaphrodites, showing an intermediate stage in evolution of distinct sexes. in 1853, it earned him the royal society's royal medal, and it made his reputation as a biologist. in 1854 he became a fellow of the linnean society of london, gaining postal access to its library. he began a major reassessment of his theory of species, and in november realised that divergence in the character of descendants could be explained by them becoming adapted to ""diversified places in the economy of nature"".

by the start of 1856, darwin was investigating whether eggs and seeds could survive travel across seawater to spread species across oceans. hooker increasingly doubted the traditional view that species were fixed, but their young friend thomas henry huxley was still firmly against the transmutation of species. lyell was intrigued by darwin's speculations without realising their extent. when he read a paper by alfred russel wallace, ""on the law which has regulated the introduction of new species"", he saw similarities with darwin's thoughts and urged him to publish to establish precedence. though darwin saw no threat, on 14 may 1856 he began writing a short paper. finding answers to difficult questions held him up repeatedly, and he expanded his plans to a ""big book on species"" titled ""natural selection"", which was to include his ""note on man"". he continued his researches, obtaining information and specimens from naturalists worldwide including wallace who was working in borneo. in mid-1857 he added a section heading; ""theory applied to races of man"", but did not add text on this topic. on 5 september 1857, darwin sent the american botanist asa gray a detailed outline of his ideas, including an abstract of ""natural selection"", which omitted human origins and sexual selection. in december, darwin received a letter from wallace asking if the book would examine human origins. he responded that he would avoid that subject, ""so surrounded with prejudices"", while encouraging wallace's theorising and adding that ""i go much further than you.""

darwin's book was only partly written when, on 18 june 1858, he received a paper from wallace describing natural selection. shocked that he had been ""forestalled"", darwin sent it on that day to lyell, as requested by wallace, and although wallace had not asked for publication, darwin suggested he would send it to any journal that wallace chose. his family was in crisis with children in the village dying of scarlet fever, and he put matters in the hands of his friends. after some discussion, with no reliable way of involving wallace, lyell and hooker decided on a joint presentation at the linnean society on 1 july of ""on the tendency of species to form varieties; and on the perpetuation of varieties and species by natural means of selection"". on the evening of 28 june, darwin's baby son died of scarlet fever after almost a week of severe illness, and he was too distraught to attend.

there was little immediate attention to this announcement of the theory; the president of the linnean society remarked in may 1859 that the year had not been marked by any revolutionary discoveries. only one review rankled enough for darwin to recall it later; professor samuel haughton of dublin claimed that ""all that was new in them was false, and what was true was old"". darwin struggled for thirteen months to produce an abstract of his ""big book"", suffering from ill health but getting constant encouragement from his scientific friends. lyell arranged to have it published by john murray.

""on the origin of species"" proved unexpectedly popular, with the entire stock of 1,250 copies oversubscribed when it went on sale to booksellers on 22 november 1859. in the book, darwin set out ""one long argument"" of detailed observations, inferences and consideration of anticipated objections. in making the case for common descent, he included evidence of homologies between humans and other mammals. having outlined sexual selection, he hinted that it could explain differences between human races. he avoided explicit discussion of human origins, but implied the significance of his work with the sentence; ""light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history."" his theory is simply stated in the introduction:
at the end of the book he concluded that:
the last word was the only variant of ""evolved"" in the first five editions of the book. ""evolutionism"" at that time was associated with other concepts, most commonly with embryological development, and darwin first used the word evolution in ""the descent of man"" in 1871, before adding it in 1872 to the 6th edition of ""the origin of species"".

the book aroused international interest, with less controversy than had greeted the popular and less scientific ""vestiges of the natural history of creation"". though darwin's illness kept him away from the public debates, he eagerly scrutinised the scientific response, commenting on press cuttings, reviews, articles, satires and caricatures, and corresponded on it with colleagues worldwide. the book did not explicitly discuss human origins, but included a number of hints about the animal ancestry of humans from which the inference could be made. the first review asked, ""if a monkey has become a manâwhat may not a man become?"" and said it should be left to theologians as it was too dangerous for ordinary readers. amongst early favourable responses, huxley's reviews swiped at richard owen, leader of the scientific establishment huxley was trying to overthrow. in april, owen's review attacked darwin's friends and condescendingly dismissed his ideas, angering darwin, but owen and others began to promote ideas of supernaturally guided evolution. patrick matthew drew attention to his 1831 book which had a brief appendix suggesting a concept of natural selection leading to new species, but he had not developed the idea.

the church of england's response was mixed. darwin's old cambridge tutors sedgwick and henslow dismissed the ideas, but liberal clergymen interpreted natural selection as an instrument of god's design, with the cleric charles kingsley seeing it as ""just as noble a conception of deity"". in 1860, the publication of ""essays and reviews"" by seven liberal anglican theologians diverted clerical attention from darwin, with its ideas including higher criticism attacked by church authorities as heresy. in it, baden powell argued that miracles broke god's laws, so belief in them was atheistic, and praised ""mr darwin's masterly volume [supporting] the grand principle of the self-evolving powers of nature"". asa gray discussed teleology with darwin, who imported and distributed gray's pamphlet on theistic evolution, ""natural selection is not inconsistent with natural theology"". the most famous confrontation was at the public 1860 oxford evolution debate during a meeting of the british association for the advancement of science, where the bishop of oxford samuel wilberforce, though not opposed to transmutation of species, argued against darwin's explanation and human descent from apes. joseph hooker argued strongly for darwin, and thomas huxley's legendary retort, that he would rather be descended from an ape than a man who misused his gifts, came to symbolise a triumph of science over religion.

even darwin's close friends gray, hooker, huxley and lyell still expressed various reservations but gave strong support, as did many others, particularly younger naturalists. gray and lyell sought reconciliation with faith, while huxley portrayed a polarisation between religion and science. he campaigned pugnaciously against the authority of the clergy in education, aiming to overturn the dominance of clergymen and aristocratic amateurs under owen in favour of a new generation of professional scientists. owen's claim that brain anatomy proved humans to be a separate biological order from apes was shown to be false by huxley in a long running dispute parodied by kingsley as the ""great hippocampus question"", and discredited owen.

darwinism became a movement covering a wide range of evolutionary ideas. in 1863 lyell's ""geological evidences of the antiquity of man"" popularised prehistory, though his caution on evolution disappointed darwin. weeks later huxley's ""evidence as to man's place in nature"" showed that anatomically, humans are apes, then ""the naturalist on the river amazons"" by henry walter bates provided empirical evidence of natural selection. lobbying brought darwin britain's highest scientific honour, the royal society's copley medal, awarded on 3 november 1864. that day, huxley held the first meeting of what became the influential ""x club"" devoted to ""science, pure and free, untrammelled by religious dogmas"". by the end of the decade most scientists agreed that evolution occurred, but only a minority supported darwin's view that the chief mechanism was natural selection.

the ""origin of species"" was translated into many languages, becoming a staple scientific text attracting thoughtful attention from all walks of life, including the ""working men"" who flocked to huxley's lectures. darwin's theory also resonated with various movements at the time and became a key fixture of popular culture. cartoonists parodied animal ancestry in an old tradition of showing humans with animal traits, and in britain these droll images served to popularise darwin's theory in an unthreatening way. while ill in 1862 darwin began growing a beard, and when he reappeared in public in 1866 caricatures of him as an ape helped to identify all forms of evolutionism with darwinism.

despite repeated bouts of illness during the last twenty-two years of his life, darwin's work continued. having published ""on the origin of species"" as an abstract of his theory, he pressed on with experiments, research, and writing of his ""big book"". he covered human descent from earlier animals including evolution of society and of mental abilities, as well as explaining decorative beauty in wildlife and diversifying into innovative plant studies.

enquiries about insect pollination led in 1861 to novel studies of wild orchids, showing adaptation of their flowers to attract specific moths to each species and ensure cross fertilisation. in 1862 ""fertilisation of orchids"" gave his first detailed demonstration of the power of natural selection to explain complex ecological relationships, making testable predictions. as his health declined, he lay on his sickbed in a room filled with inventive experiments to trace the movements of climbing plants. admiring visitors included ernst haeckel, a zealous proponent of ""darwinismus"" incorporating lamarckism and goethe's idealism. wallace remained supportive, though he increasingly turned to spiritualism.

darwin's book ""the variation of animals and plants under domestication"" (1868) was the first part of his planned ""big book"", and included his unsuccessful hypothesis of pangenesis attempting to explain heredity. it sold briskly at first, despite its size, and was translated into many languages. he wrote most of a second part, on natural selection, but it remained unpublished in his lifetime.
lyell had already popularised human prehistory, and huxley had shown that anatomically humans are apes. with ""the descent of man, and selection in relation to sex"" published in 1871, darwin set out evidence from numerous sources that humans are animals, showing continuity of physical and mental attributes, and presented sexual selection to explain impractical animal features such as the peacock's plumage as well as human evolution of culture, differences between sexes, and physical and cultural racial classification, while emphasising that humans are all one species. his research using images was expanded in his 1872 book ""the expression of the emotions in man and animals"", one of the first books to feature printed photographs, which discussed the evolution of human psychology and its continuity with the behaviour of animals. both books proved very popular, and darwin was impressed by the general assent with which his views had been received, remarking that ""everybody is talking about it without being shocked."" his conclusion was ""that man with all his noble qualities, with sympathy which feels for the most debased, with benevolence which extends not only to other men but to the humblest living creature, with his god-like intellect which has penetrated into the movements and constitution of the solar systemâwith all these exalted powersâman still bears in his bodily frame the indelible stamp of his lowly origin.""

his evolution-related experiments and investigations led to books on orchids, ""insectivorous plants, the effects of cross and self fertilisation in the vegetable kingdom"", different forms of flowers on plants of the same species, and ""the power of movement in plants"". his botanical work was interpreted and popularised by various writers including grant allen and h. g. wells, and helped transform plant science in the late 19th century and early 20th century. in his last book he returned to ""the formation of vegetable mould through the action of worms"".

in 1882 he was diagnosed with what was called ""angina pectoris"" which then meant coronary thrombosis and disease of the heart. at the time of his death, the physicians diagnosed ""anginal attacks"", and ""heart-failure"". it has been speculated that darwin may have suffered from chronic chagas disease. this speculation is based on a journal entry written by darwin, describing he was bitten by the ""kissing bug"" in mendoza, argentina, in 1835; and based on the constellation of clinical symptoms he exhibited, including cardiac disease which is a hallmark of chronic chagas disease. exhuming darwin's body is likely necessary to definitively determine his state of infection by detecting dna of infecting parasite, ""t. cruzi"", that causes chagas disease.

he died at down house on 19 april 1882. his last words were to his family, telling emma ""i am not the least afraid of deathâremember what a good wife you have been to meâtell all my children to remember how good they have been to me"", then while she rested, he repeatedly told henrietta and francis ""it's almost worth while to be sick to be nursed by you"". he had expected to be buried in st mary's churchyard at downe, but at the request of darwin's colleagues, after public and parliamentary petitioning, william spottiswoode (president of the royal society) arranged for darwin to be honoured by burial in westminster abbey, close to john herschel and isaac newton. the funeral was held on wednesday 26 april and was attended by thousands of people, including family, friends, scientists, philosophers and dignitaries.

by the time of his death, darwin and his colleagues had convinced most scientists that evolution as descent with modification was correct, and he was regarded as a great scientist who had revolutionised ideas. in june 1909, though few at that time agreed with his view that ""natural selection has been the main but not the exclusive means of modification"", he was honoured by more than 400 officials and scientists from across the world who met in cambridge to commemorate his centenary and the fiftieth anniversary of ""on the origin of species"". around the beginning of the 20th century, a period that has been called ""the eclipse of darwinism"", scientists proposed various alternative evolutionary mechanisms, which eventually proved untenable. ronald fisher, an english statistician, finally united mendelian genetics with natural selection, in the period between 1918 and his 1930 book ""the genetical theory of natural selection"". he gave the theory a mathematical footing and brought broad scientific consensus that natural selection was the basic mechanism of evolution, thus founding the basis for population genetics and the modern evolutionary synthesis, with j.b.s. haldane and sewall wright, which set the frame of reference for modern debates and refinements of the theory.

during darwin's lifetime, many geographical features were given his name. an expanse of water adjoining the beagle channel was named ""darwin sound"" by robert fitzroy after darwin's prompt action, along with two or three of the men, saved them from being marooned on a nearby shore when a collapsing glacier caused a large wave that would have swept away their boats, and the nearby mount darwin in the andes was named in celebration of darwin's 25th birthday. when the ""beagle"" was surveying australia in 1839, darwin's friend john lort stokes sighted a natural harbour which the ship's captain wickham named ""port darwin"": a nearby settlement was renamed darwin in 1911, and it became the capital city of australia's northern territory.
more than 120 species and nine genera have been named after darwin. in one example, the group of tanagers related to those darwin found in the galã¡pagos islands became popularly known as ""darwin's finches"" in 1947, fostering inaccurate legends about their significance to his work.

darwin's work has continued to be celebrated by numerous publications and events. the linnean society of london has commemorated darwin's achievements by the award of the darwinâwallace medal since 1908. darwin day has become an annual celebration, and in 2009 worldwide events were arranged for the bicentenary of darwin's birth and the 150th anniversary of the publication of ""on the origin of species"".

darwin has been commemorated in the uk, with his portrait printed on the reverse of â£10 banknotes printed along with a hummingbird and hms ""beagle"", issued by the bank of england.

a life-size seated statue of darwin can be seen in the main hall of the natural history museum in london.

a seated statue of darwin, unveiled 1897, stands in front of shrewsbury library, the building that used to house shrewsbury school, which darwin attended as a boy. another statue of darwin as a young man is situated in the grounds of christ's college, cambridge.

darwin college, a postgraduate college at cambridge university, is named after the darwin family.

2008â09 the swedish band the knife, in collaboration with danish performance group hotel pro forma and other musicians from denmark, sweden and the us, created an opera about the life of darwin, and the origin of species, titled tomorrow, in a year. the show toured european theatres in 2010.

the darwins had ten children: two died in infancy, and annie's death at the age of ten had a devastating effect on her parents. charles was a devoted father and uncommonly attentive to his children. whenever they fell ill, he feared that they might have inherited weaknesses from inbreeding due to the close family ties he shared with his wife and cousin, emma wedgwood.

he examined inbreeding in his writings, contrasting it with the advantages of outcrossing in many species. despite his fears, most of the surviving children and many of their descendants went on to have distinguished careers.

of his surviving children, george, francis and horace became fellows of the royal society, distinguished as astronomer, botanist and civil engineer, respectively. all three were knighted. another son, leonard, went on to be a soldier, politician, economist, eugenicist and mentor of the statistician and evolutionary biologist ronald fisher.

darwin's family tradition was nonconformist unitarianism, while his father and grandfather were freethinkers, and his baptism and boarding school were church of england. when going to cambridge to become an anglican clergyman, he did not doubt the literal truth of the bible. he learned john herschel's science which, like william paley's natural theology, sought explanations in laws of nature rather than miracles and saw adaptation of species as evidence of design. on board hms ""beagle"", darwin was quite orthodox and would quote the bible as an authority on morality. he looked for ""centres of creation"" to explain distribution, and suggested that the very similar antlions found in australia and england were evidence of a divine hand.

by his return, he was critical of the bible as history, and wondered why all religions should not be equally valid. in the next few years, while intensively speculating on geology and the transmutation of species, he gave much thought to religion and openly discussed this with his wife emma, whose beliefs also came from intensive study and questioning. the theodicy of paley and thomas malthus vindicated evils such as starvation as a result of a benevolent creator's laws, which had an overall good effect. to darwin, natural selection produced the good of adaptation but removed the need for design, and he could not see the work of an omnipotent deity in all the pain and suffering, such as the ichneumon wasp paralysing caterpillars as live food for its eggs. though he thought of religion as a tribal survival strategy, darwin was reluctant to give up the idea of god as an ultimate lawgiver. he was increasingly troubled by the problem of evil.

darwin remained close friends with the vicar of downe, john brodie innes, and continued to play a leading part in the parish work of the church, but from around 1849 would go for a walk on sundays while his family attended church. he considered it ""absurd to doubt that a man might be an ardent theist and an evolutionist"" and, though reticent about his religious views, in 1879 he wrote that ""i have never been an atheist in the sense of denying the existence of a god.â â i think that generally ... an agnostic would be the most correct description of my state of mind"".

the ""lady hope story"", published in 1915, claimed that darwin had reverted to christianity on his sickbed. the claims were repudiated by darwin's children and have been dismissed as false by historians.

darwin's views on social and political issues reflected his time and social position. he grew up in a family of whig reformers who, like his uncle josiah wedgwood, supported electoral reform and the emancipation of slaves. darwin was passionately opposed to slavery, while seeing no problem with the working conditions of english factory workers or servants. his taxidermy lessons in 1826 from the freed slave john edmonstone, who he long recalled as ""a very pleasant and intelligent man"", reinforced his belief that black people shared the same feelings, and could be as intelligent as people of other races. he took the same attitude to native people he met on the ""beagle"" voyage. these attitudes were not unusual in britain in the 1820s, much as it shocked visiting americans. british society became more racist in mid century, but darwin remained strongly against slavery, against ""ranking the so-called races of man as distinct species"", and against ill-treatment of native people. darwins interaction with yaghans (fuegians) such as jemmy button during the second voyage of hms beagle had a profound impact on his view of primitive peoples. at his arrival to tierra del fuego he made a colourful description of ""fuegian savages"". this view changed as he came to know yaghan people more in detail. by studying the yaghans darwin concluded that a number of basic emotions by different human groups were the same and that mental capabilities were roughly the same as for europeans. while interested in yaghan culture darwin failed to appreciate their deep ecological knowledge and elaborate cosmology until the 1850s when he inspected a dictionary of yaghan detailing 32-thousand words. he recognised that european colonisation often led to the extinction of native civilisations.

he thought men's eminence over women was the outcome of sexual selection, a view disputed by antoinette brown blackwell in her 1875 book ""the sexes throughout nature"".

darwin was intrigued by his half-cousin francis galton's argument, introduced in 1865, that statistical analysis of heredity showed that moral and mental human traits could be inherited, and principles of animal breeding could apply to humans. in ""the descent of man"", darwin noted that aiding the weak to survive and have families could lose the benefits of natural selection, but cautioned that withholding such aid would endanger the instinct of sympathy, ""the noblest part of our nature"", and factors such as education could be more important. when galton suggested that publishing research could encourage intermarriage within a ""caste"" of ""those who are naturally gifted"", darwin foresaw practical difficulties, and thought it ""the sole feasible, yet i fear utopian, plan of procedure in improving the human race"", preferring to simply publicise the importance of inheritance and leave decisions to individuals. francis galton named this field of study ""eugenics"" in 1883. after darwin's death, his theories were cited to promote eugenic policies that went against his humanitarian principles.

darwin's fame and popularity led to his name being associated with ideas and movements that, at times, had only an indirect relation to his writings, and sometimes went directly against his express comments.

thomas malthus had argued that population growth beyond resources was ordained by god to get humans to work productively and show restraint in getting families; this was used in the 1830s to justify workhouses and laissez-faire economics. evolution was by then seen as having social implications, and herbert spencer's 1851 book ""social statics"" based ideas of human freedom and individual liberties on his lamarckian evolutionary theory.

soon after the ""origin"" was published in 1859, critics derided his description of a struggle for existence as a malthusian justification for the english industrial capitalism of the time. the term ""darwinism"" was used for the evolutionary ideas of others, including spencer's ""survival of the fittest"" as free-market progress, and ernst haeckel's polygenistic ideas of human development. writers used natural selection to argue for various, often contradictory, ideologies such as laissez-faire dog-eat-dog capitalism, colonialism and imperialism. however, darwin's holistic view of nature included ""dependence of one being on another""; thus pacifists, socialists, liberal social reformers and anarchists such as peter kropotkin stressed the value of co-operation over struggle within a species. darwin himself insisted that social policy should not simply be guided by concepts of struggle and selection in nature.

after the 1880s, a eugenics movement developed on ideas of biological inheritance, and for scientific justification of their ideas appealed to some concepts of darwinism. in britain, most shared darwin's cautious views on voluntary improvement and sought to encourage those with good traits in ""positive eugenics"". during the ""eclipse of darwinism"", a scientific foundation for eugenics was provided by mendelian genetics. negative eugenics to remove the ""feebleminded"" were popular in america, canada and australia, and eugenics in the united states introduced compulsory sterilisation laws, followed by several other countries. subsequently, nazi eugenics brought the field into disrepute.

the term ""social darwinism"" was used infrequently from around the 1890s, but became popular as a derogatory term in the 1940s when used by richard hofstadter to attack the laissez-faire conservatism of those like william graham sumner who opposed reform and socialism. since then, it has been used as a term of abuse by those opposed to what they think are the moral consequences of evolution.

darwin was a prolific writer. even without publication of his works on evolution, he would have had a considerable reputation as the author of ""the voyage of the beagle"", as a geologist who had published extensively on south america and had solved the puzzle of the formation of coral atolls, and as a biologist who had published the definitive work on barnacles. while ""on the origin of species"" dominates perceptions of his work, ""the descent of man"" and ""the expression of the emotions in man and animals"" had considerable impact, and his books on plants including ""the power of movement in plants"" were innovative studies of great importance, as was his final work on ""the formation of vegetable mould through the action of worms"".

. darwin was eminent as a naturalist, geologist, biologist, and author. after working as a physician's assistant and two years as a medical student, he was educated as a clergyman; he was also trained in taxidermy.

. robert fitzroy was to become known after the voyage for biblical literalism, but at this time he had considerable interest in lyell's ideas, and they met before the voyage when lyell asked for observations to be made in south america. fitzroy's diary during the ascent of the river santa cruz in patagonia recorded his opinion that the plains were raised beaches, but on return, newly married to a very religious lady, he recanted these ideas.

. in the section ""morphology"" of chapter xiii of ""on the origin of species"", darwin commented on homologous bone patterns between humans and other mammals, writing: ""what can be more curious than that the hand of a man, formed for grasping, that of a mole for digging, the leg of the horse, the paddle of the porpoise, and the wing of the bat, should all be constructed on the same pattern, and should include the same bones, in the same relative positions?"" and in the concluding chapter: ""the framework of bones being the same in the hand of a man, wing of a bat, fin of the porpoise, and leg of the horse â¦ at once explain themselves on the theory of descent with slow and slight successive modifications.""
in ""on the origin of species"" darwin mentioned human origins in his concluding remark that ""in the distant future i see open fields for far more important researches. psychology will be based on a new foundation, that of the necessary acquirement of each mental power and capacity by gradation. light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history.""

in ""chapter vi: difficulties on theory"" he referred to sexual selection: ""i might have adduced for this same purpose the differences between the races of man, which are so strongly marked; i may add that some little light can apparently be thrown on the origin of these differences, chiefly through sexual selection of a particular kind, but without here entering on copious details my reasoning would appear frivolous.""

in ""the descent of man"" of 1871, darwin discussed the first passage:
""during many years i collected notes on the origin or descent of man, without any intention of publishing on the subject, but rather with the determination not to publish, as i thought that i should thus only add to the prejudices against my views. it seemed to me sufficient to indicate, in the first edition of my 'origin of species,' that by this work 'light would be thrown on the origin of man and his history;' and this implies that man must be included with other organic beings in any general conclusion respecting his manner of appearance on this earth."" in a preface to the 1874 second edition, he added a reference to the second point: ""it has been said by several critics, that when i found that many details of structure in man could not be explained through natural selection, i invented sexual selection; i gave, however, a tolerably clear sketch of this principle in the first edition of the 'origin of species,' and i there stated that it was applicable to man.""

. see, for example, willa volume 4, ""charlotte perkins gilman and the feminization of education"" by deborah m. de simone: ""gilman shared many basic educational ideas with the generation of thinkers who matured during the period of ""intellectual chaos"" caused by darwin's origin of the species. marked by the belief that individuals can direct human and social evolution, many progressives came to view education as the panacea for advancing social progress and for solving such problems as urbanisation, poverty, or immigration.""

. see, for example, the song ""a lady fair of lineage high"" from gilbert and sullivan's ""princess ida"", which describes the descent of man (but not woman!) from apes.

. darwin's belief that black people had the same essential humanity as europeans, and had many mental similarities, was reinforced by the lessons he had from john edmonstone in 1826. early in the ""beagle"" voyage, darwin nearly lost his position on the ship when he criticised fitzroy's defence and praise of slavery. he wrote home about ""how steadily the general feeling, as shown at elections, has been rising against slavery. what a proud thing for england if she is the first european nation which utterly abolishes it! i was told before leaving england that after living in slave countries all my opinions would be altered; the only alteration i am aware of is forming a much higher estimate of the negro character."" regarding fuegians, he ""could not have believed how wide was the difference between savage and civilized man: it is greater than between a wild and domesticated animal, inasmuch as in man there is a greater power of improvement"", but he knew and liked civilised fuegians like jemmy button: ""it seems yet wonderful to me, when i think over all his many good qualities, that he should have been of the same race, and doubtless partaken of the same character, with the miserable, degraded savages whom we first met here.""

in the ""descent of man"", he mentioned the similarity of fuegians' and edmonstone's minds to europeans' when arguing against ""ranking the so-called races of man as distinct species"".

he rejected the ill-treatment of native people, and for example wrote of massacres of patagonian men, women, and children, ""every one here is fully convinced that this is the most just war, because it is against barbarians. who would believe in this age that such atrocities could be committed in a christian civilized country?""

. geneticists studied human heredity as mendelian inheritance, while eugenics movements sought to manage society, with a focus on social class in the united kingdom, and on disability and ethnicity in the united states, leading to geneticists seeing this as impractical pseudoscience. a shift from voluntary arrangements to ""negative"" eugenics included compulsory sterilisation laws in the united states, copied by nazi germany as the basis for nazi eugenics based on virulent racism and ""racial hygiene"".()
"
sachin tendulkar,"
sachin ramesh tendulkar (; born 24 april 1973) is an indian former international cricketer and a former captain of the indian national team. he is widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen in the history of cricket. he is the highest run scorer of all time in international cricket. tendulkar took up cricket at the age of eleven, made his test debut on 15 november 1989 against pakistan in karachi at the age of sixteen, and went on to represent mumbai domestically and india internationally for close to twenty-four years. he is the only player to have scored one hundred international centuries, the first batsman to score a double century in an odi, the holder of the record for the most runs in both test and odi, and the only player to complete more than 30,000 runs in international cricket. he is colloquially known as little master or master blaster,
in 2001, sachin tendulkar became the first batsman to complete 10,000 odi runs in his 259 innings. in 2002, halfway through his career, ""wisden cricketers' almanack"" ranked him the second greatest test batsman of all time, behind don bradman, and the second greatest odi batsman of all time, behind viv richards. later in his career, tendulkar was a part of the indian team that won the 2011 world cup, his first win in six world cup appearances for india. he had previously been named ""player of the tournament"" at the 2003 edition of the tournament, held in south africa. in 2013, he was the only indian cricketer included in an all-time test world xi named to mark the 150th anniversary of ""wisden cricketers' almanack"".

tendulkar received the arjuna award in 1994 for his outstanding sporting achievement, the rajiv gandhi khel ratna award in 1997, india's highest sporting honour, and the padma shri and padma vibhushan awards in 1999 and 2008, respectively, india's fourth and second highest civilian awards. after a few hours of his final match on 16 november 2013, the prime minister's office announced the decision to award him the bharat ratna, india's highest civilian award. he is the youngest recipient to date and the first ever sportsperson to receive the award. he also won the 2010 sir garfield sobers trophy for cricketer of the year at the icc awards. in 2012, tendulkar was nominated to the rajya sabha, the upper house of the parliament of india. he was also the first sportsperson and the first person without an aviation background to be awarded the honorary rank of group captain by the indian air force. in 2012, he was named an honorary member of the order of australia.

in 2010, ""time"" magazine included sachin in its annual time 100 list as one of the ""most influential people in the world"".
in december 2012, tendulkar announced his retirement from odis. he retired from twenty20 cricket in october 2013 and subsequently retired from all forms of cricket on 16 november 2013 after playing his 200th test match, against the west indies in mumbai's wankhede stadium. tendulkar played 664 international cricket matches in total, scoring 34,357 runs.

in 2019, tendulkar was inducted into the icc cricket hall of fame.

tendulkar was born at nirmal nursing home in dadar, bombay on 24 april 1973 to a maharashtrian rajapur saraswat brahmin family. his father, ramesh tendulkar, was a well-known marathi novelist & poet and his mother, rajni, worked in the insurance industry. ramesh named tendulkar after his favourite music director, sachin dev burman. tendulkar has three elder siblings: two half-brothers nitin and ajit, and a half-sister savita. they were ramesh's children by his first wife, who died after the birth of her third child.

tendulkar spent his formative years in the ""sahitya sahawas cooperative housing society"" in bandra (east). as a young boy, tendulkar was considered a bully, and often picked up fights with new children in his school. he also showed an interest in tennis, idolising john mcenroe. to help curb his mischievous and bullying tendencies, ajit introduced the young sachin to cricket in 1984. he introduced him to ramakant achrekar, a famous cricket coach and a club cricketer of repute, at shivaji park, dadar. in the first meeting, the young sachin did not play his best. ajit told achrekar that he was feeling self-conscious due to the coach observing him, and was not displaying his natural game. ajit requested the coach to give him another chance at playing, but watch while hiding behind a tree. this time, sachin, apparently unobserved, played much better and was accepted at achrekar's academy.

achrekar was impressed with tendulkar's talent and advised him to shift his schooling to sharadashram vidyamandir (english) high school, a school at dadar which had a dominant cricket team and had produced many notable cricketers. prior to this, tendulkar had attended the indian education society's new english school in bandra (east). he was also coached under the guidance of achrekar at shivaji park in the mornings and evenings. tendulkar would practice for hours on end in the nets. if he became exhausted, achrekar would put a one-rupee coin on the top of the stumps, and the bowler who dismissed tendulkar would get the coin. if tendulkar passed the whole session without getting dismissed, the coach would give him the coin. tendulkar now considers the 13 coins he won then as some of his most prized possessions. he moved in with his aunt and uncle, who lived near shivaji park, during this period, due to his hectic schedule.
meanwhile, at school, he developed a reputation as a child prodigy. he had become a common conversation point in local cricketing circles, where there were suggestions already that he would become one of the greats. sachin consistently featured in the school team in the matunga gujarati seva mandal (mgsm) shield. besides school cricket, he also played club cricket, initially representing john bright cricket club in bombay's premier club cricket tournament, the kanga league, and later went on to play for the cricket club of india. in 1987, at the age of 14, he attended the mrf pace foundation in madras (now chennai) to train as a fast bowler, but australian fast bowler dennis lillee, who took a world record 355 test wickets, was unimpressed, suggesting that tendulkar focus on his batting instead. on 20 january 1987, he also turned out as substitute for imran khan's side in an exhibition game at brabourne stadium in bombay, to mark the golden jubilee of cricket club of india. a couple of months later, former indian batsman sunil gavaskar gave him a pair of his own ultra light pads and consoled him to not get disheartened for not getting the bombay cricket association's ""best junior cricket award"" (he was 14 years that time). ""it was the greatest source of encouragement for me,"" tendulkar said nearly 20 years later after surpassing gavaskar's world record of 34 test centuries. sachin served as a ball boy in the 1987 cricket world cup when india played against england in the semifinal in bombay. in his season in 1988, tendulkar scored a century in every innings he played. he was involved in an unbroken 664-run partnership in a lord harris shield inter-school game against st. xavier's high school in 1988 with his friend and teammate vinod kambli, who would also go on to represent india. the destructive pair reduced one bowler to tears and made the rest of the opposition unwilling to continue the game. tendulkar scored 326 (not out) in this innings and scored over a thousand runs in the tournament. this was a record partnership in any form of cricket until 2006, when it was broken by two under-13 batsmen in a match held at hyderabad in india.

on 14 november 1987, tendulkar was selected to represent bombay in the ranji trophy, india's premier domestic first-class cricket tournament, for the 1987â88 season. however, he was not selected for the final eleven in any of the matches, though he was often used as a substitute fielder. he narrowly missed out on playing alongside his idol gavaskar, who had retired from all forms of cricket after the 1987 cricket world cup. a year later, on 11 december 1988, aged 15 years and 232 days, tendulkar made his debut for bombay against gujarat at home and scored 100 not out in that match, making him the youngest indian to score a century on debut in first-class cricket. he was handpicked to play for the team by the then bombay captain dilip vengsarkar after watching him easily negotiating india's best fast bowler at the time, kapil dev, in the wankhede stadium nets, where the indian team had come to play against the touring new zealand team. he followed this by scoring a century in his first deodhar and duleep trophies, which are also indian domestic tournaments.

tendulkar finished the 1988â89 ranji trophy season as bombay's highest run-scorer. he scored 583 runs at an average of 67.77, and was the eighth highest run-scorer overall. he also made an unbeaten century in the irani trophy match against delhi at the start of the 1989â90 season, playing for the rest of india. sachin was picked for a young indian team to tour england twice, under the star cricket club banner in 1988 and 1989. in the famous 1990â91 ranji trophy final, in which haryana defeated bombay by two runs after leading in the first innings, tendulkar's 96 from 75 deliveries was a key to giving bombay a chance of victory as it attempted to chase 355 from only 70 overs on the final day.

his first double century (204*) was for mumbai while playing against the visiting australian team at the brabourne stadium in 1998. he is the only player to score a century on debut in all three of his domestic first-class tournaments (the ranji, irani, and duleep trophies). another double century was an innings of 233* against tamil nadu in the semi-finals of the 2000 ranji trophy, which he regards as one of the best innings of his career.

in 1992, at the age of 19, tendulkar became the first overseas-born player to represent yorkshire, which prior to tendulkar joining the team, never selected players even from other english counties. selected for yorkshire as a replacement for the injured australian fast bowler craig mcdermott, tendulkar played 16 first-class matches for the county and scored 1070 runs at an average of 46.52.

raj singh dungarpur is credited for the selection of tendulkar for the indian tour of pakistan in late 1989, after one first class season. the indian selection committee had shown interest in selecting tendulkar for the tour of the west indies held earlier that year, but eventually did not select him, as they did not want him to be exposed to the dominant fast bowlers of the west indies so early in his career. tendulkar made his test debut against pakistan in karachi in november 1989 aged 16 years and 205 days. he made 15 runs, being bowled by waqar younis, who also made his debut in that match, but was noted for how he handled numerous blows to his body at the hands of the pakistani pace attack. in the fourth and final test in sialkot, he was hit on the nose by a bouncer bowled by younis, but he declined medical assistance and continued to bat even as he gushed blood from it. in a 20-over exhibition game in peshawar, held in parallel with the bilateral series, tendulkar made 53 runs off 18 balls, including an over in which he scored 27 runs (6, 4, 0, 6, 6, 6) off leg-spinner abdul qadir. this was later called ""one of the best innings i have seen"" by the then indian captain krishnamachari srikkanth. in all, he scored 215 runs at an average of 35.83 in the test series, and was dismissed without scoring a run in the only one day international (odi) he played. thus sachin tendulkar became the youngest player to debut for india in tests at the age of 16 years and 205 days and also the youngest player to debut for india in odis at the age of 16 years and 238 days.

the series was followed by a tour of new zealand in which he scored 117 runs at an average of 29.25 in tests including an innings of 88 in the second test. he was dismissed without scoring in one of the two one-day games he played, and scored 36 in the other. on his next tour, a summer tour to england of 1990, on 14 august, he became the second youngest cricketer to score a test century as he made 119 not out in the second test at old trafford in manchester, an innings which contributed to a draw and saved india from certain defeat in the match. wisden described his innings as ""a disciplined display of immense maturity"" and also wrote:
he looked the embodiment of india's famous opener, gavaskar, and indeed was wearing a pair of his pads. while he displayed a full repertoire of strokes in compiling his maiden test hundred, most remarkable were his off-side shots from the back foot. though only 5ft 5in tall, he was still able to control without difficulty short deliveries from the english pacemen.
tendulkar further enhanced his reputation as a future great during the 1991â92 tour of australia held before the 1992 cricket world cup, that included an unbeaten 148 in the third test at sydney, making him the youngest batsman to score a century in australia. he then scored 114 on a fast, bouncing pitch in the final test at perth against a pace attack comprising merv hughes, bruce reid and craig mcdermott. hughes commented to allan border at the time that ""this little prick's going to get more runs than you, ab.""

tendulkar's performance through the years 1994â1999 coincided with his physical peak, in his early twenties. he opened the batting at auckland against new zealand in 1994, making 82 runs off 49 balls. he scored his first odi century on 9 september 1994 against australia in sri lanka at colombo. it took him 78 odis to score his first century.
tendulkar's rise continued when he was the leading run scorer at the 1996 world cup, scoring two centuries. he was the only indian batsman to perform well in the semi-final against sri lanka. tendulkar fell amid a batting collapse and the match referee, clive lloyd, awarded sri lanka the match after the crowd began rioting and throwing litter onto the field.

after the world cup, in the same year against pakistan at sharjah, indian captain mohammed azharuddin was going through a lean patch. tendulkar and navjot singh sidhu both made centuries to set a then record partnership for the second wicket. after getting out, tendulkar found azharuddin in two minds about whether he should bat. tendulkar convinced azharuddin to bat and azharuddin subsequently unleashed 24 runs off one over. india went on to win that match. it enabled india to post a score in excess of 300 runs for the first time in an odi.

this was the beginning of a period at the top of the batting world, culminating in the australian tour of india in early 1998, with tendulkar scoring three consecutive centuries. the focus was on the clash between tendulkar, the world's most dominating batsman and shane warne, the world's leading spinner, both at the peak of their careers, clashing in a test series. in the lead-up to the series, tendulkar simulated scenarios in the nets with laxman sivaramakrishnan, the former india leg spinner, donning the role of warne. in their tour opener, australia faced the then ranji champions mumbai at the brabourne stadium in a three-day first class match. tendulkar made an unbeaten 204 as shane warne conceded 111 runs in 16 overs and australia lost the match within three days. he also had a role with the ball in the five-match odi series in india following the tests, including a five wicket haul in an odi in kochi. set 310 runs to win, australia were cruising at 203 for 3 in the 31st over when tendulkar turned the match for india, taking the wickets of michael bevan, steve waugh, darren lehmann, tom moody and damien martyn for 32 runs in 10 overs. the test match success was followed by two consecutive centuries in april 1998 in a triangular cricket tournament in sharjah â the first in a must-win game to take india to the finals and then again in the finals, both against australia. these twin knocks were also known as the desert storm innings. following the series, warne ruefully joked that he was having nightmares about his indian nemesis.

tendulkar's contribution in the icc 1998 quarterfinal at dhaka paved the way for india's entry into the semifinals, when he took four australian wickets after scoring 141 runs in 128 balls.

the inaugural asian test championship took place in february and march 1999, involving india, pakistan, and sri lanka. in the first match, between india and pakistan in eden gardens, tendulkar was run out for nine after colliding with pakistan bowler shoaib akhtar. around 100,000 people came to support india during the initial four days of the tournament, breaking a 63-year-old record for aggregate test attendance record. the crowd's reaction to tendulkar's dismissal was to throw objects at akhtar, and the players were taken off the field. the match resumed after tendulkar and the president of the icc appealed to the crowd; however, further rioting meant that the match was finished in front of a crowd of 200â people. tendulkar scored his 19th test century in the second test and the match resulted in a draw with sri lanka. india did not progress to the final, which was won by pakistan, and refused to participate the next time the championship was held due to increasing political tensions between india and pakistan.

in the test against pakistan at chepauk in 1999, the first of a two-test series, sachin scored 136 in the fourth innings with india chasing 271 for victory. however, he was out when india needed 17 more runs to win, triggering a batting collapse, and india lost the match by 12 runs. the worst was yet to come as professor ramesh tendulkar, sachin's father, died in the middle of the 1999 cricket world cup. tendulkar flew back to india to attend the final rituals of his father, missing the match against zimbabwe. however, he returned to the world cup scoring a century (140 not out off 101 balls) in his very next match against kenya in bristol. he dedicated this century to his father.

tendulkar's two tenures as captain of the indian cricket team were not very successful. when tendulkar took over as captain in 1996, it was with huge hopes and expectations. however, by 1997 the team was performing poorly. azharuddin was credited with saying """"nahin jeetega! chote ki naseeb main jeet nahin hai!"""", which translates into: ""he won't win! it's not in the small one's destiny!"".

tendulkar, succeeding azharuddin as captain for his second term, led india on a tour of australia, where the visitors were beaten 3â0 by the newly crowned world champions. tendulkar, however, won the player of the series award as well as player of the match in one of the games. after another test series defeat, this time by a 0â2 margin at home against south africa, tendulkar resigned, and sourav ganguly took over as captain in 2000.

during the indian team's 2007 tour of england, the desire of rahul dravid to resign from the captaincy became known. the bcci president sharad pawar offered the captaincy to tendulkar, who instead recommended mahendra singh dhoni to take over the reins. pawar later revealed this conversation, crediting tendulkar for first forwarding the name of dhoni, who since achieved much success as captain.

in india's 2001 tour of south africa in the second test match between india and south africa at st george's park, port elizabeth, match referee mike denness fined four indian players for excessive appealing, as well as fined the indian captain sourav ganguly for not controlling his team. tendulkar was given a suspended ban of one game by denness in light of alleged ball tampering. television cameras picked up images that suggested tendulkar may have been involved in cleaning the seam of the cricket ball. this can, under some conditions, amount to altering the condition of the ball. denness found sachin tendulkar guilty of ball tampering charges and handed him a one test match ban. the incident escalated to include sports journalists accusing denness of racism, and led to denness being barred from entering the venue of the third test match. the icc revoked the status of the match as a test as the teams rejected the appointed referee. the charges against tendulkar and sehwag's ban for excessive appealing triggered a massive backlash from the indian public.

sachin tendulkar continued performing well in test cricket in 2001 and 2002, with some pivotal performances with both bat and ball. tendulkar took three wickets on the final day of the famous kolkata test against australia in 2001. tendulkar took the key wickets of matthew hayden and adam gilchrist, who were centurions in the previous test. he also take a wicket of shane warne.this three wicket change the result of test match from draw to win of india. in the five-match odi series that followed, he took his 100th wicket in odis, claiming the wicket of then australian captain steve waugh in the final match at the fatorda stadium in goa.

in the 2002 series in the west indies, tendulkar started well, scoring 79 in the first test. in the second test at port of spain, sachin tendulkar scored 117 in the first innings, his 29th test century in his 93rd test match, to equal sir donald bradman's record of 29 test hundreds.he was awarded by sports car ""ferrari"" by michael schumacher for achieving this feat.

then, in a hitherto unprecedented sequence, he scored 0, 0, 8 and 0 in the next four innings. he returned to form in the last test scoring 41 and 86, one half century. however, india lost the series. in this period, in the third test match against england in august 2002, sachin scored his 30th test century to surpass bradman's haul, in his 99th test match.

tendulkar made 673 runs in 11 matches in the 2003 cricket world cup, helping india reach the final. while australia retained the trophy that they had won in 1999, tendulkar was given the man of the tournament award.

he continued to score heavily in odi cricket that year, with two hundreds in a tri-series involving new zealand and australia. as a part-time bowler, he dismissed an exhausted centurion, matthew hayden in the tri-series final.

the drawn series as india toured australia in 2003â04 saw tendulkar making his mark in the last test of the series, with 241 not out from 436 ball by 33 four at strike rate of 55.27 in sydney, putting india in a virtually unbeatable position. he spend 613 minute at crease. india have a first inning score of 705/7. he followed up the innings with an unbeaten 60 in the second innings of the test. prior to this test match, he had had an unusually horrible run of form, failing in all six innings in the preceding three tests. it was no aberration that 2003 was his worst year in test cricket, with an average of 17.25 and just one fifty.

tendulkar scored an unbeaten 194 against pakistan at multan in the following series. indian captain rahul dravid declared before tendulkar reached 200; had he done so it would have been the fourth time he had passed the landmark in tests. tendulkar said that he was disappointed and that the declaration had taken him by surprise. many former cricketers commented that dravid's declaration was in bad taste. after the match, which india won, dravid said that the matter had been discussed internally and put to rest.

a tennis elbow injury then took its toll on tendulkar, leaving him out of the side for most of the year, coming back only for the last two tests when australia toured india in 2004. he played a part in india's victory in mumbai in that series with a fast 55, though australia took the series 2â1. for his performances in 2004, he was named as 12th man in the world test xi by icc. he was also named in the odi xi for the same year.

on 10 december 2005 at feroz shah kotla, tendulkar scored his record-breaking 35th test century, against the sri lankans. after this, tendulkar endured the longest spell of his career without a test century: 17â innings elapsed before he scored 101 against bangladesh in may 2007. tendulkar scored his 39th odi hundred on 6 february 2006 in a match against pakistan. he followed with a 42 in the second one-day international against pakistan on 11 february 2006, and then a 95 in hostile, seaming conditions on 13 february 2006 in lahore, which set up an indian victory. on 19 march 2006, after being dismissed for only one run against england in the first innings of the third test in his home ground, wankhede, tendulkar was booed off the ground by a section of the crowd, the first time that he had ever faced such flak. tendulkar ended the three-test series without a half-century to his credit, and the need for a shoulder operation raised more questions about his longevity.

tendulkar's comeback came in the dlf cup in malaysia and he was the only indian batsman to shine. in his comeback match, against west indies on 14 september 2006, tendulkar responded to his critics who believed that his career was inexorably sliding with his 40th odi century. though he scored 141 not out, west indies won the rain-affected match by the d/l method.

during the preparation for the 2007 world cup, tendulkar's attitude was criticised by indian team coach greg chappell. chappell reportedly felt that tendulkar would be more useful down the order, while the latter felt that he would be better off opening the innings, the role he had played for most of his career. chappell also believed that tendulkar's repeated failures were hurting the team's chances. in a rare show of emotion, tendulkar hit out at the comments attributed to chappell by pointing out that no coach had ever suggested his attitude towards cricket was incorrect. on 7 april 2007, the board of control for cricket in india issued a notice to tendulkar asking for an explanation for his comments made to the media. chappell subsequently resigned as coach but said that this affair had no bearing on his decision and that he and tendulkar were on good terms.

at the world cup in the west indies, tendulkar and the indian cricket team led by rahul dravid had a dismal campaign. tendulkar, who was pushed to bat lower down the order had scores of 7 against bangladesh, 57 not out against bermuda and 0 against sri lanka. as a result, former australian captain ian chappell, brother of greg, called for tendulkar to retire in his newspaper column.

in the subsequent test series against bangladesh, tendulkar returned to his opening slot and was chosen as the man of the series. he continued by scoring 99 and 93 in the first two matches of the future cup against south africa. during the second match, he also became the first to score 15,000 runs in odis. he was the leading run scorer and was adjudged the man of the series.
on the second day of the nottingham test on 28 july 2007, tendulkar became the third cricketer to complete 11,000 test runs.
in the subsequent one-day series against england, tendulkar was the leading run scorer from india with an average of 53.42. in the odi series against australia in october 2007 tendulkar was the leading indian run scorer with 278 runs.

tendulkar was dismissed seven times in 2007 between 90 and 100, including three times at 99, leading some to suggestions that he struggles to cope with nervousness in this phase of his innings. tendulkar has got out 27 times in the 90s during his international career. in a five-odi series against pakistan, he was caught by kamran akmal off the bowling of umar gul for 99 in the second match at mohali, and in the fourth match of that series, he got out in the 90s for a second time, scoring 97 before dragging a delivery from gul on to his stumps. his knock was named as the second-best odi batting performance of the year by espncricinfo.

for his performances in 2007, he was named in the world odi xi by the icc and cricinfo.

in the border-gavaskar trophy, 2007â08, tendulkar showed exceptional form, becoming the leading run scorer with 493 runs in four tests, despite consistently failing in the second innings. sachin scored 62 runs in the first innings of the first test at the mcg in melbourne, but could not prevent a heavy 337-run win for australia. in the controversial new years' test at sydney, tendulkar scored an unbeaten 154, even though india lost the test. this was his third century at the scg and his 38th test century overall, earning him an average of 326 at the ground at the time of completing the innings. in the third test at the waca cricket ground in perth, sachin was instrumental in india's first innings score of 330, scoring a well-compiled 71. india went on to record a historic triumph at the waca, ending australia's run of 16 consecutive wins. in the fourth test at the adelaide oval, which ended in a draw, he scored 153 in the first innings, being involved in a crucial 126 run stand with v.v.s. laxman for the fifth wicket to lead india to a score of 282 for 5 from 156 for 4. he secured the man of the match award.

in the one-day international commonwealth bank tri-series involving india, sri lanka and australia, tendulkar became the only batsman to complete 16,000 runs in odis. he achieved this feat against sri lanka on 5 february 2008 at the gabba in brisbane. he started the series wth scores of 10, 35, 44 and 32. his form dipped a bit in the middle of the tournament, but tendulkar came back strongly in india's must-win game against sri lanka at the bellerive oval in hobart, scoring 63 off 54 balls. he finished the series with a match winning 117 not out off 120 balls in the first final, and 91 runs in the second final. both the knocks were nominated to be the odi batting performance of the year by espncricinfo.

south africa toured in march and april 2008 for a three-test series. tendulkar scored a five-ball duck in his only innings of the series; he sustained a groin strain in the match and as a result was forced not only to miss the second and third tests, but also the tri-series involving bangladesh, the 2008 asia cup, and the first half of the inaugural season of the ipl.

before the indian cricket team's tour of sri lanka in july 2008, tendulkar needed 177 runs to go past brian lara's record of test 11,953 runs. however, he failed in all six innings, scoring a total of 95 runs. india lost the series and his average of 15.83 was his worst in a test series with at least three matches.

in the following odi series against sri lanka, tendulkar was sidelined due to injury. however, during the following australia tour of india, he returned to fitness and form, scoring 13 and 49 in the first test before making 88 in the first innings of the second test, breaking the record for most test runs held by brian lara. he also reached the 12,000 run mark when he was on 61. he described the achievement as the biggest in 19 years of his career on the day he achieved the record. he made a fifty in the third test and 109 in the fourth, as india won the series 2â0 and regained the border-gavaskar trophy.

tendulkar was again out of the first three odis of a seven-match odi series at home against england due to an injury, but he made 11 in the fourth odi and 50 in the fifth, before the series was called off due to the 2008 mumbai terrorist attacks, the scoreline being 5â0 to india.

england returned for a two-match test series in december 2008, and the first test, which was originally planned to be held in mumbai, was shifted to chennai following the terror attacks. chasing 387 for victory in that match, tendulkar scored 103 not out and shared a 163-run unbroken fifth wicket partnership with yuvraj singh. this was his third century in the fourth innings of a test match, and the first which resulted in a win. he dedicated this century to the victims of the mumbai terror attacks. the knock was nominated to be one of the test batting performance of the year by espncricinfo. tendulkar scored poorly in the second test at mohali, which ended in a draw. india won the series 1â0.

for his performances in 2008, he was named in the world odi xi by the icc. he was also named in the world test xi by cricinfo.

in early 2009, india revisited sri lanka for five odis, as the pakistan series had been cancelled due to the security situation in pakistan and the attacks in mumbai. tendulkar scored 5, 6 and 7 in the first three matches, being dismissed leg before wicket in all of them, and did not play in the remaining two matches.

india's next assignment was an away series against new zealand, consisting of three tests and five odis. in the odi series, tendulkar made an unbeaten 163 in the third match before stomach cramps forced him to end his innings. india made 392, won the match and eventually won the series 3â1. tendulkar made 160 in the first test, his 42nd test century, and india won. he made 49 and 64 in the second test and 62 and 9 in the third, in which play was halted on the last day due to rain with india needing only two wickets to win. india won the series 1â0.

tendulkar rested himself for the odi tour of west indies, but was back for the compaq cup tri series between india, sri lanka and new zealand in early september 2009. he made 46 and 27 in the league matches before notching up 138 in the final, as india made 319 and won by 46 runs. this was tendulkar's sixth century in a final of an odi tournament and his third consecutive score of over 50 in such finals.

tendulkar played only one innings in the icc champions trophy in south africa, scoring 8 against pakistan as india lost. the next match against australia was abandoned due to rain and he was out with a stomach infection in the third match against the west indies, as india were eliminated.

australia returned for a seven-match odi series in india in october, and tendulkar made 14, 4, 32 and 40 in the first four games. in the fifth match, with the series tied at 2â2, australia amassed 350/4 in 50 overs. tendulkar made his 45th odi hundred, a 175 off 141 balls. just when it seemed that he would steer india to the large victory target, he tried to scoop a slower delivery from debutant bowler clint mckay over short fine leg only to be caught by nathan hauritz, with india needing 19 runs to win with 18 balls and four wickets left. the indian tail collapsed, and australia won the match by three runs. during this match, tendulkar also became the first player to reach 17,000 odi runs, and achieved his personal best against australia, as well as the third highest score in a defeat. the knock was voted as the best odi batting performance of 2009 by espncricinfo.

in the five-match odi series against sri lanka in 2009â10, tendulkar scored 69, 43, 96 not out and 8 in the first four matches, with the fifth match being abandoned as the pitch was deemed unfit and potentially dangerous. india won the series 3â1. in the test series that followed, he scored a 100 not out in the first test, which was drawn, and 40 and 53 in the second and third tests respectively as india clinched innings victories in both the tests, to win the series 2â0.
for his performances in 2009, he was named in the world test xi by the icc.

sachin rested himself for the odi tri-series in bangladesh in 2010, but played in the subsequent test series. he made 105 not out and 16 in the first test, and 143 in the second. india won both the tests.

in the two-test series against south africa, tendulkar made 7 and 100 in the first test. he then scored 106 in the first innings of the second test, which was his 47th hundred in test cricket. it was also his fourth hundred in successive tests, and he was the fourth indian to achieve this feat. in the second match of the subsequent odi series, tendulkar scored 200 not out, becoming the world's first batsman to score a double century in odi cricket and breaking the previous highest score of 194 jointly held by pakistan's saeed anwar and zimbabwe's charles coventry. the knock was voted as the best odi batting performance of the year by espncricinfo.

for his performances in 2010, he was named both in the world test xi and odi xi by the icc.

his knock of 146 against south africa at cape town was voted as the best test batting performance of the year 2011 by espncricinfo.

from february to april, bangladesh, india, and sri lanka hosted the 2011 world cup. amassing 482â runs at an average of 53.55 including two centuries, tendulkar was india's leading run-scorer for the tournament; only tillakaratne dilshan of sri lanka scored more runs in the 2011 tournament. india defeated sri lanka in the final. shortly after the victory, tendulkar commented that ""winning the world cup is the proudest moment of my life.â ... i couldn't control my tears of joy.""
he was named in the 'team of the tournament' for the 2011 world cup by the icc and cricinfo.

india were due to tour the west indies in june, although tendulkar chose not to participate. he returned to the squad in july for india's tour of england. throughout the tour there was much hype in the media about whether tendulkar would reach his 100th century in international cricket (test and odis combined). however his highest score in the tests was 91; tendulkar averaged 34.12 in the series as england won 4â0 as they deposed india as the no.â 1 ranked test side. the injury tendulkar sustained to his right foot in 2001 flared up and as a result he was ruled out of the odi series that followed. tendulkar created another record on 8 november 2011 when he became the first cricketer to score 15,000 runs in test cricket, during the opening test match against the west indies at the feroz shah kotla stadium in new delhi. for his performances in 2011, he was named in the world test xi by the icc.

ian chappell was not happy with sachin's performance after india's tour of australia. he says that sachin's quest for his 100th hundred has proved to be a hurdle for the entire team and has hampered their performance on the tour of australia. former india world cup winning captain and all-rounder kapil dev has also voiced his opinion that sachin should have retired from odi's after the world cup. former australian fast bowler, geoff lawson, has said that sachin has the right to decide when to quit although he adds that tendulkar should not delay it for too long.
the selection committee of bcci expectedly included sachin in the national test squad for the upcoming series against new zealand commencing in august 2012.

tendulkar scored his 100th international hundred on 16 march 2012, at mirpur against bangladesh in the asia cup. he became the first person in history to achieve this feat, which was also his first odi hundred against bangladesh. he said ""it's been a tough phase for meâ ... i was not thinking about the milestone, the media started all this, wherever i went, the restaurant, room service, everyone was talking about the 100th hundred. nobody talked about my 99â hundreds. it became mentally tough for me because nobody talked about my 99â hundreds."" despite tendulkar's century, india failed to win the match against bangladesh, losing by 5 wickets.

after being bowled out in three similar instances against new zealand and hitting a slump in form, tendulkar returned to the ranji trophy to get back some form ahead of the england series at home, in a match for mumbai against railways on 2 november 2012. this was his first ranji trophy match since 2009. he scored 137 off 136 balls, with 21 fours and 3 sixes, to take his team to 344 for 4 at stumps on day one.

however, because of a poor form in the first two tests in the series against england, and india being humiliated in the second match of that series by 10 wickets on 26 november 2012, some people have started to question his place in the indian team. a report by ""the hindustan times"" said that tendulkar had a discussion with the national chief selector sandeep patil, in which he said that he would leave it to the selectors to decide on his future as he is not getting any runs. this speculation, however, was later considered to be false.

then he decided to play in the knockout stage of the 2012-13 ranji trophy. he scored 108 in the quarter final against baroda before being bowled by murtuja vahora, where sachin was involved in a 234-run partnership with opener wasim jaffer (150) for the 3rd wicket at wankhede stadium. mumbai eventually piled on 645/9 and won on 1st innings lead. in the semi final against services at palam a ground, with mumbai reeling at 23/3, sachin scored 56 from 75 balls and had an 81-run 4th wicket partnership with abhishek nayar (70), and mumbai eventually won on 1st innings lead after the match went into the sixth day due to rain delays. in the final against saurashtra, he was run out for 22 following a misunderstanding with wasim jaffer. mumbai eventually won the ranji trophy 2012â13.

he also played in the irani trophy for mumbai, where he scored 140* against rest of india and helped mumbai to score 409 in reply to rest of india's 526. this was also his 81st hundred in first-class cricket, equalling sunil gavaskar's indian record for most first-class hundreds.

following poor performance in the 2012 series against england, tendulkar announced his retirement from one day internationals on 23 december 2012, while noting that he will be available for test cricket. in response to the news, former india captain sourav ganguly noted that tendulkar could have played the up-coming series against pakistan, while anil kumble said it would be ""tough to see an indian (odi) team list without tendulkar's name in it"", and javagal srinath mentioned that tendulkar ""changed the way odis were played right from the time he opened in new zealand in 1994"".

after playing a twenty20 international in 2006 against south africa, he said that he would not play the format again. he announced his retirement from the ipl after his team, mumbai indians, beat chennai super kings by 23 runs at the eden gardens in kolkata on 26 may to win the indian premier league 2013. he retired from twenty20 cricket and limited-overs cricket, after playing the 2013 champions league twenty20 in septemberâoctober 2013 in india for mumbai indians.

on 10 october 2013 tendulkar announced that he would retire from all cricket after the two-test series against west indies in november. at his request, the bcci arranged that the two matches be played at kolkata and mumbai so that the farewell would happen at his home ground. he scored 74 runs in his last test innings against west indies, thus failing short by 79 runs to complete 16,000 runs in test cricket, the next man to bat after him was the future captain virat kohli. the cricket association of bengal and the mumbai cricket association organised events to mark his retirement from the sport. various national and international figures from cricket, politics, bollywood and other fields spoke about him in a day-long ""salaam sachin conclave"" organised by ""india today"".

in july 2014, he captained the mcc side in the bicentenary celebration match at lord's.
in december 2014, he was announced ambassador of the icc cricket world cup 2015 event. it is his second term as he has already held the ambassador of the previous icc cricket world cup 2011. so he is heading the ambassador position of the icc cricket world cup in consecutive terms of the cricket world cup (2011 and 2015).

tendulkar was made the icon player and captain for his home side, the mumbai indians in the inaugural indian premier league twenty20 competition in 2008. as an icon player, he was signed for a sum of us$1,121,250, 15% more than the second-highest paid player in the team, sanath jayasuriya.

in 2010 edition of indian premier league, mumbai indians reached the final of the tournament. tendulkar made 618 runs in 14 innings during the tournament, breaking shaun marsh's record of most runs in an ipl season. he was declared player of the tournament for his performance during the season. he also won best batsman and best captain awards at 2010 ipl awards ceremony. sachin has scored more than 500 runs in ipl in two different seasons as a captain. for his performances in 2010 and 2011, he was named in the cricinfo ipl xi..

sachin tendulkar captained mumbai indians in 4 league matches of second edition of the league. he scored 68 in the first match and 48 against guyana. but mumbai indians failed to qualify for semifinals after losing the initial two matches. tendulkar scored 135 runs.

in the 2011 ipl, against kochi tuskers kerala, tendulkar scored his maiden twenty20â hundred. he scored 100 not out off 66 balls. in 51â matches in the ipl tendulkar has scored 1,723 runs, making him the second-highest run-scorer in the competition's history.
in 2013, sachin retired from indian premier league and currently in 2014 he is appointed as the mumbai indian team's 'icon'.

tendulkar is cross-dominant: he bats, bowls and throws with his right hand, but writes with his left hand. he also practices left-handed throws at the nets on a regular basis. cricinfo columnist sambit bal has described him as the ""most wholesome batsman of his time"". his batting is based on complete balance and poise while limiting unnecessary movements and flourishes. he appears to show little preference for the slow and low wickets which are typical in india, and has scored many centuries on the hard, bouncy pitches in south africa and australia. he is known for his unique punch style of hitting the ball over square. he is also renowned for his picture-perfect straight drive, often completed with no follow-through. the straight drive is often said to be his favourite shot. in 2008, sunil gavaskar, in an article he wrote in the afp, remarked that ""it is hard to imagine any player in the history of the game who combines classical technique with raw aggression like the little champion does"". equipment-wise, his bats tend to be heavier than the average batman.

sir donald bradman, considered by many as the greatest batsman of all time, considered tendulkar to have a batting style similar to his. in his biography, it is stated that ""bradman was most taken by tendulkar's technique, compactness and shot production, and had asked his wife to have a look at tendulkar, having felt that tendulkar played like him. bradman's wife, jessie, agreed that they did appear similar.""

former australian cricket team coach john buchanan voiced his opinion that tendulkar had become susceptible to the short ball early in his innings because of a lack of footwork. buchanan also believes tendulkar has a weakness while playing left-arm pace. he was affected by a series of injuries since 2004. since then tendulkar's batting has tended to be less attacking. explaining this change in his batting style, he has acknowledged that he is batting differently because, firstly, no batsman can bat the same way for the entire length of a long career and, secondly, he is a senior member of the team now and thus has more responsibility. during the early part of his career, he was a more attacking batsman and frequently scored centuries at close to a run a ball. ian chappell, former australian player, remarked in 2007 that ""tendulkar now, is nothing like the player he was when he was a young bloke"".

tendulkar has incorporated several modern and unorthodox strokes into his repertoire, including the paddle sweep, the scoop over short fine leg and the slash to third man over the slips' heads, over the last seven or eight years. he is often praised for his ability to adapt to the needs of his body and yet keep scoring consistently.
while tendulkar is not a regular bowler, he can bowl medium pace, leg spin, and off spin. he often bowls when two batsmen of the opposite team have been batting together for a long period, as he can often be a useful partnership breaker. with his bowling, he has helped secure an indian victory on more than one occasion. he has taken 201 international wickets â 46 in tests, 154 in odis where he is india's twelfth highest wicket taker, and one wicket in twenty20 internationals.

to mark 150 years of the cricketers' almanack, wisden named him in an all-time test world xi.

tendulkar's consistent performances earned him a fan following across the globe, including amongst australian crowds, where tendulkar has consistently scored centuries. one of the most popular sayings by his fans is ""cricket is my religion and sachin is my god"". ""cricinfo"" mentions in his profile that ""...â tendulkar remains, by a distance, the most worshipped cricketer in the world."" during the australian tour of india in 1998 matthew hayden said ""i have seen god. he bats at no. 4 in india in tests."" however, on god, tendulkar himself is reported to have said ""i am not god of cricket. i make mistakes, god doesn't."" tendulkar made a special appearance in the bollywood film ""stumped"" in 2003, appearing as himself.

there have been many instances when tendulkar's fans have undertaken extreme activities over his dismissal in the game. as reported by many indian newspapers, a person hanged himself due to distress over tendulkar's failure to reach his 100th century.

at home in mumbai, tendulkar's fan following has caused him to lead a different lifestyle. ian chappell has said that he would be unable to cope with the lifestyle tendulkar was forced to lead, having to ""wear a wig and go out and watch a movie only at night"". in an interview with tim sheridan, tendulkar admitted that he sometimes went for quiet drives in the streets of mumbai late at night when he would be able to enjoy some peace and silence. tendulkar has a presence in the popular social networking site twitter with the user name , since may 2010.

sachin tendulkar is the leading run scorer in tests, with 15,921 runs, as well as in one-day internationals, with 18,426 runs. he is the only player to score more than 30,000 runs in all forms of international cricket (tests, odis and twenty20 internationals). he is the 16th player and the first indian to score 50,000 runs in all forms of domestic and international recognised cricket (first-class, list a and twenty20). he achieved this feat on 5 october 2013, during a champions league twenty20 match for his ipl team mumbai indians against trinidad and tobago.

in 2012, tendulkar was ranked number 8 in outlook india's poll of the greatest indian.

he also holds the record of the highest number of centuries in both tests (51) and odis (49) as well as in tests and odis combined (100). on 16 march 2012, tendulkar scored his 100th international hundred. it came against bangladesh in the league matches of asia cup 2012. he is also the only player to score fifty centuries in test cricket, and the first to score fifty centuries in all international cricket combined. he also holds the world record for playing the highest number of test matches (200) and odi matches (463). tendulkar has been part of most wins by an indian in both test cricket with 72 wins and odis with 234 wins and is third in the world in odi victories after ricky ponting (262 wins), mahela jayawardene (241 wins).

tendulkar has scored over 1000 runs in a calendar year in odis 7 times, and in 1998 he scored 1,894 runs, the record for the highest number of runs scored by any player in a single calendar year for one-day internationals. he is the first male cricketer to score a double-century in one-day cricket.

he has been man of the match 13 times in test matches and man of the series four times, out of them twice in the border-gavaskar trophy against australia. the performances earned him respect from australian cricket fans and players. similarly he has been man of the match 62 times in one day international matches and man of the series 15 times. he became the first batsman to score 12,000, 13,000, 14,000 and 15,000 runs in test cricket, having also been the third batsman and the first indian to pass 11,000 runs in that form of the game. he was also the first player to score 10,000 runs in one-day internationals, and also the first player to cross every subsequent 1000-run mark that has been crossed in odi cricket history. in the fourth test of the 2008â09 border-gavaskar trophy against australia at nagpur on 6 november 2008, tendulkar surpassed australia's allan border to become the player to cross the 50-run mark the most times in test cricket history, and also the second ever player to score 11 test centuries against australia, tying with sir jack hobbs of england more than 70 years previously. on 8 november 2011, tendulkar became the first batsman to score 15,000 runs in test cricket.

tendulkar has consistently done well in cricket world cups. he was the highest run scorer of the 1996 cricket world cup with a total of 523 runs and also of the 2003 cricket world cup with 673 runs. after his century against england during group stages of 2011 cricket world cup, he became the player to hit most centuries in cricket world cups with six centuries and the first player to score 2000 runs in world cup cricket.



on 24 may 1995, tendulkar married anjali mehta (b. 1967), a paediatrician of gujarati origin, whom he had first met in 1990. they have a daughter sara and a son arjun whose skills in cricket as a teenager have been receiving attention.

tendulkar is a practising hindu. he is a devotee of the deity ganesha and was a disciple of the guru sathya sai baba of puttaparthi, whom he visited on several occasions. in 1997, tendulkar captained the indian national side, playing against a world eleven team, in the unity cup which was held at the sri sathya sai hill view stadium in puttaparthi, in baba's presence. the death of sai baba on tendulkar's 38th birthday caused him to cancel his celebrations. the cricketer is also known to celebrate ganesh chaturthi at home and frequently visits temples during night when it is calm and quiet.

"
narendra modi,"
narendra damodardas modi (; born 17 september 1950) is an indian politician serving as the 14th and current prime minister of india since 2014. he was the chief minister of gujarat from 2001 to 2014 and is the member of parliament for varanasi. modi is a member of the bharatiya janata party (bjp) and of the rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (rss), a hindu nationalist volunteer organisation. he is the first prime minister outside of the indian national congress to win two consecutive terms with a full majority and the second to complete five years in office after atal bihari vajpayee.

born to a gujarati family in vadnagar, modi helped his father sell tea as a child and has said he later ran his own stall. he was introduced to the rss at the age of eight, beginning a long association with the organisation. modi left home after finishing high-school in part due to an arranged marriage to jashodaben chimanlal, which he abandoned and publicly acknowledged only many decades later. modi travelled around india for two years and visited a number of religious centres before returning to gujarat. in 1971 he became a full-time worker for the rss. during the state of emergency imposed across the country in 1975, modi was forced to go into hiding. the rss assigned him to the bjp in 1985 and he held several positions within the party hierarchy until 2001, rising to the rank of general secretary.

modi was appointed chief minister of gujarat in 2001 due to keshubhai patel's failing health and poor public image following the earthquake in bhuj. modi was elected to the legislative assembly soon after. his administration has been considered complicit in the 2002 gujarat riots or otherwise criticised for its handling of it. a supreme court-appointed special investigation team found no evidence to initiate prosecution proceedings against modi personally. his policies as chief minister, credited with encouraging economic growth, have received praise. his administration has been criticised for failing to significantly improve health, poverty and education indices in the state.

modi led the bjp in the 2014 general election which gave the party a majority in the indian lower house of parliament, the lok sabha, the first time for any single party since 1984. modi's administration has tried to raise foreign direct investment in the indian economy and reduced spending on healthcare and social welfare programmes. modi has attempted to improve efficiency in the bureaucracy; he has centralised power by abolishing the planning commission. he began a high-profile sanitation campaign and weakened or abolished environmental and labour laws. he initiated a controversial demonetisation of high-denomination banknotes. described as engineering a political realignment towards right-wing politics, modi remains a figure of controversy domestically and internationally over his hindu nationalist beliefs and his role during the 2002 gujarat riots, cited as evidence of an exclusionary social agenda.

narendra modi was born on 17 september 1950 to a family of grocers in vadnagar, mehsana district, bombay state (present-day gujarat). he was the third of six children born to damodardas mulchand modi (c. 1915â1989) and hiraben modi (born c. 1920). modi's family belonged to the modh-ghanchi-teli (oil-presser) community, which is categorised as an other backward class by the indian government.

as a child, modi helped his father sell tea at the vadnagar railway station, and said that he later ran a tea stall with his brother near a bus terminus. modi completed his higher secondary education in vadnagar in 1967, where a teacher described him as an average student and a keen debater, with interest in theatre. modi had an early gift for rhetoric in debates, and his teachers and students noted this. modi preferred playing larger-than-life characters in theatrical productions, which has influenced his political image.

when eight years old, modi discovered the rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (rss) and began attending its local ""shakhas"" (training sessions). there, modi met lakshmanrao inamdar, popularly known as vakil saheb, who inducted him as a ""balswayamsevak"" (junior cadet) in the rss and became his political mentor. while modi was training with the rss, he also met vasant gajendragadkar and nathalal jaghda, bharatiya jana sangh leaders who were founding members of the bjp's gujarat unit in 1980.

also in narendra modi's childhood, in a custom traditional to his caste, his family arranged a betrothal to a girl, jashodaben chimanlal modi, leading to their marriage when they were teenagers. sometime thereafter, he abandoned the further marital obligations implicit in the custom, and left home, the couple going on to lead separate lives, neither marrying again, and the marriage itself remaining unmentioned in modi's public pronouncements for many decades. in april 2014, shortly before the national elections that swept him to power, modi publicly affirmed that he was married and his spouse was jashodaben; the couple has remained married, but estranged.

modi spent the ensuing two years travelling across northern and north-eastern india, though few details of where he went have emerged. in interviews, modi has described visiting hindu ashrams founded by swami vivekananda: the belur math near kolkata, followed by the advaita ashrama in almora and the ramakrishna mission in rajkot. modi remained only a short time at each, since he lacked the required college education. vivekananda has been described as a large influence in modi's life.

in the early summer of 1968, modi reached the belur math but was turned away, after which modi wandered through calcutta, west bengal and assam, stopping in siliguri and guwahati. modi then went to the ramakrishna ashram in almora, where he was again rejected, before travelling back to gujarat via delhi and rajasthan in 1968â69. sometime in late 1969 or early 1970, modi returned to vadnagar for a brief visit before leaving again for ahmedabad. there, modi lived with his uncle, working in the latter's canteen at the gujarat state road transport corporation.

in ahmedabad, modi renewed his acquaintance with inamdar, who was based at the hedgewar bhavan (rss headquarters) in the city. after the indo-pakistani war of 1971, he stopped working for his uncle and became a full-time ""pracharak"" (campaigner) for the rss, working under inamdar. shortly before the war, modi took part in a non-violent protest against the indian government in new delhi, for which he was arrested; this has been cited as a reason for inamdar electing to mentor him. many years later modi would co-author a biography of inamdar, published in 2001.

in 1978 modi received a bachelor of arts degree in political science from school of open learning at university of delhi, graduating with a third class. five years later, in 1983, he received a master of arts degree in political science from gujarat university, graduating with a first class as an external distance learning student.

in june 1975, prime minister indira gandhi declared a state of emergency in india which lasted until 1977. during this period, known as ""the emergency"", many of her political opponents were jailed and opposition groups were banned. modi was appointed general secretary of the ""gujarat lok sangharsh samiti"", an rss committee co-ordinating opposition to the emergency in gujarat. shortly afterwards, the rss was banned. modi was forced to go underground in gujarat and frequently travelled in disguise to avoid arrest. he became involved in printing pamphlets opposing the government, sending them to delhi and organising demonstrations. modi was also involved with creating a network of safe houses for individuals wanted by the government, and in raising funds for political refugees and activists. during this period, modi wrote a book in gujarati, ""sangharsh ma gujarat"" (""in the struggles of gujarat""), describing events during the emergency. among the people he met in this role was trade unionist and socialist activist george fernandes, as well as several other national political figures. in his travels during the emergency, modi was often forced to move in disguise, once dressing as a monk, and once as a sikh.

modi became an rss ""sambhag pracharak"" (regional organiser) in 1978, overseeing rss activities in the areas of surat and vadodara, and in 1979 he went to work for the rss in delhi, where he was put to work researching and writing the rss's version of the history of the emergency. he returned to gujarat a short while later, and was assigned by the rss to the bjp in 1985. in 1987 modi helped organise the bjp's campaign in the ahmedabad municipal election, which the bjp won comfortably; modi's planning has been described as the reason for that result by biographers. after l. k. advani became president of the bjp in 1986, the rss decided to place its members in important positions within the bjp; modi's work during the ahmedabad election led to his selection for this role, and modi was elected organising secretary of the bjp's gujarat unit later in 1987.

modi rose within the party and was named a member of the bjp's national election committee in 1990, helping organise l. k. advani's 1990 ram rath yatra in 1990 and murli manohar joshi's 1991â92 ""ekta yatra"" (journey for unity). however, he took a brief break from politics in 1992, instead establishing a school in ahmedabad; friction with shankersingh vaghela, a bjp mp from gujarat at the time, also played a part in this decision. modi returned to electoral politics in 1994, partly at the insistence of advani, and as party secretary, modi's electoral strategy was considered central to the bjp victory in the 1995 state assembly elections. in november of that year modi was elected bjp national secretary and transferred to new delhi, where he assumed responsibility for party activities in haryana and himachal pradesh. the following year, shankersinh vaghela, a prominent bjp leader from gujarat, defected to the indian national congress (congress, inc) after losing his parliamentary seat in the lok sabha elections. modi, on the selection committee for the 1998 assembly elections in gujarat, favoured supporters of bjp leader keshubhai patel over those supporting vaghela to end factional division in the party. his strategy was credited as key to the bjp winning an overall majority in the 1998 elections, and modi was promoted to bjp general secretary (organisation) in may of that year.

in 2001, keshubhai patel's health was failing and the bjp lost a few state assembly seats in by-elections. allegations of abuse of power, corruption and poor administration were made, and patel's standing had been damaged by his administration's handling of the earthquake in bhuj in 2001. the bjp national leadership sought a new candidate for the chief ministership, and modi, who had expressed misgivings about patel's administration, was chosen as a replacement. although bjp leader l. k. advani did not want to ostracise patel and was concerned about modi's lack of experience in government, modi declined an offer to be patel's deputy chief minister, telling advani and atal bihari vajpayee that he was ""going to be fully responsible for gujarat or not at all"". on 3 october 2001 he replaced patel as chief minister of gujarat, with the responsibility of preparing the bjp for the december 2002 elections. modi was sworn in as chief minister on 7 october 2001, and entered the gujarat state legislature on 24 february 2002 by winning a by-election to the rajkot â ii constituency, defeating ashwin mehta of the inc by 14,728 votes.

on 27 february 2002, a train with several hundred passengers burned near godhra, killing approximately 60 people. the train carried a large number of hindu pilgrims returning from ayodhya after a religious ceremony at the site of the demolished babri masjid. in making a public statement after the incident, modi declared it a terrorist attack planned and orchestrated by local muslims. the next day, the vishwa hindu parishad called for a ""bandh"" across the state. riots began during the ""bandh"", and anti-muslim violence spread through gujarat. the government's decision to move the bodies of the train victims from godhra to ahmedabad further inflamed the violence. the state government stated later that 790 muslims and 254 hindus were killed. independent sources put the death toll at over 2000. approximately 150,000 people were driven to refugee camps. numerous women and children were among the victims; the violence included mass rapes and mutilations of women.

the government of gujarat itself is generally considered by scholars to have been complicit in the riots, and has otherwise received heavy criticism for its handling of the situation. several scholars have described the violence as a pogrom, while others have called it an example of state terrorism. summarising academic views on the subject, martha nussbaum said: ""there is by now a broad consensus that the gujarat violence was a form of ethnic cleansing, that in many ways it was premeditated, and that it was carried out with the complicity of the state government and officers of the law."" the modi government imposed a curfew in 26 major cities, issued shoot-at-sight orders and called for the army to patrol the streets, but was unable to prevent the violence from escalating. the president of the state unit of the bjp expressed support for the ""bandh"", despite such actions being illegal at the time. state officials later prevented riot victims from leaving the refugee camps, and the camps were often unable to meet the needs of those living there. muslim victims of the riots were subject to further discrimination when the state government announced that compensation for muslim victims would be half of that offered to hindus, although this decision was later reversed after the issue was taken to court. during the riots, police officers often did not intervene in situations where they were able. in 2012 maya kodnani, a minister in modi's government from 2007 to 2009, was convicted by a lower court for participation in the naroda patiya massacre during the 2002 riots. although modi's government had announced that it would seek the death penalty for kodnani on appeal, it reversed its decision in 2013. on 21 april 2018, the gujarat high court acquitted kodnani while noting that there were several shortfalls in the investigation.

modi's personal involvement in the 2002 events has continued to be debated. during the riots, modi said that ""what is happening is a chain of action and reaction."" later in 2002, modi said the way in which he had handled the media was his only regret regarding the episode. in march 2008, the supreme court reopened several cases related to the 2002 riots, including that of the gulbarg society massacre, and established a special investigation team (sit) to look into the issue. in response to a petition from zakia jafri (widow of ehsan jafri, who was killed in the gulbarg society massacre), in april 2009 the court also asked the sit to investigate the issue of modi's complicity in the killings. the sit questioned modi in march 2010; in may, it presented to the court a report finding no evidence against him. in july 2011, the court-appointed ""amicus curiae"" raju ramachandran submitted his final report to the court. contrary to the sit's position, he said that modi could be prosecuted based on the available evidence. the supreme court gave the matter to the magistrate's court. the sit examined ramachandran's report, and in march 2012 submitted its final report, asking for the case to be closed. zakia jaffri filed a protest petition in response. in december 2013 the magistrate's court rejected the protest petition, accepting the sit's finding that there was no evidence against the chief minister.

in the aftermath of the violence there were widespread calls for modi to resign as chief minister from within and outside the state, including from leaders of the dravida munnetra kazhagam and the telugu desam party (allies in the bjp-led national democratic alliance coalition), and opposition parties stalled parliament over the issue. modi submitted his resignation at the april 2002 bjp national executive meeting in goa, but it was not accepted. his cabinet had an emergency meeting on 19 july 2002, after which it offered its resignation to the gujarat governor s. s. bhandari, and the state assembly was dissolved. despite opposition from the election commissioner, who said that a number of voters were still displaced, modi succeeded in advancing the election to december 2002. in the elections, the bjp won 127 seats in the 182-member assembly. although modi later denied it, he made significant use of anti-muslim rhetoric during his campaign, and the bjp profited from religious polarisation among the voters. he won the maninagar constituency, receiving of votes and defeating inc candidate yatin oza by 75,333 votes. on 22 december 2002, bhandari swore modi in for a second term. modi framed the criticism of his government for human rights violations as an attack upon gujarati pride, a strategy which led to the bjp winning two-thirds of the seats in the state assembly.

during modi's second term the rhetoric of the government shifted from hindutva to gujarat's economic development. modi curtailed the influence of sangh parivar organisations such as the bharatiya kisan sangh (bks) and the vishva hindu parishad (vhp), entrenched in the state after the decline of ahmedabad's textile industry, and dropped gordhan zadafia (an ally of former sangh co-worker and vhp state chief praveen togadia) from his cabinet. when the bks staged a farmers' demonstration modi ordered their eviction from state-provided houses, and his decision to demolish 200 illegal temples in gandhinagar deepened the rift with the vhp. sangh organisations were no longer consulted or informed in advance about modi's administrative decisions. nonetheless, modi retained connections with some hindu nationalists. modi wrote a foreword to a textbook by dinanath batra released in 2014, which stated that ancient india possessed technologies including test-tube babies.

modi's relationship with muslims continued to attract criticism. prime minister atal bihari vajpayee (who asked modi for tolerance in the aftermath of the 2002 gujarat violence and supported his resignation as chief minister) distanced himself, reaching out to north indian muslims before the 2004 lok sabha elections. after the elections vajpayee called the violence in gujarat a reason for the bjp's electoral defeat and said it had been a mistake to leave modi in office after the riots.

questions about modi's relationship with muslims were also raised by many western nations during his tenure as chief minister. modi was barred from entering the united states by the state department, in accordance with the recommendations of the commission on international religious freedom formed under the aegis of the international religious freedom act, the only person denied a us visa under this law. the uk and the european union refused to admit him because of what they saw as his role in the riots. as modi rose to prominence in india, the uk and the eu lifted their bans in october 2012 and march 2013, respectively, and after his election as prime minister he was invited to washington.

during the run-up to the 2007 assembly elections and the 2009 general election, the bjp intensified its rhetoric on terrorism. in july 2006, modi criticised prime minister manmohan singh ""â for his reluctance to revive anti-terror legislation"" such as the 2002 prevention of terrorism act. he asked the national government to allow states to invoke tougher laws in the wake of the 2006 mumbai train bombings. in 2007 modi authored ""karmayog"", a 101-page booklet discussing manual scavenging. in it, modi argued that scavenging was a ""spiritual experience"" for valmiks, a sub-caste of dalits. however, this book was not circulated that time because of the election code of conduct. after the november 2008 mumbai attacks, modi held a meeting to discuss the security of gujarat's -long coastline, resulting in government authorisation of 30 high-speed surveillance boats. in july 2007 modi completed 2,063 consecutive days as chief minister of gujarat, making him the longest-serving holder of that post, and the bjp won 122 of 182 state-assembly seats in that year's election.

as chief minister, modi favoured privatisation and small government, which was at odds with the philosophy of the rss, usually described as anti-privatisation and anti-globalisation. his policies during his second term have been credited with reducing corruption in the state. he established financial and technology parks in gujarat and during the 2007 vibrant gujarat summit, real-estate investment deals worth 6.6â trillion were signed.

the governments led by patel and modi supported ngos and communities in the creation of groundwater-conservation projects. by december 2008, 500,000 structures had been built, of which 113,738 were check dams, which helped recharge the aquifers beneath them. sixty of the 112 tehsils which had depleted the water table in 2004 had regained their normal groundwater levels by 2010. as a result, the state's production of genetically modified cotton increased to become the largest in india. the boom in cotton production and its semi-arid land use led to gujarat's agricultural sector growing at an average rate of 9.6 percent from 2001 to 2007. public irrigation measures in central and southern gujarat, such as the sardar sarovar dam, were less successful. the sardar sarovar project only irrigated 4â6% of the area intended. nonetheless, from 2001 to 2010 gujarat recorded an agricultural growth rate of 10.97 percent â the highest of any state. however, sociologists have pointed out that the growth rate under the 1992â97 inc government was 12.9 percent. in 2008 modi offered land in gujarat to tata motors to set up a plant manufacturing the nano after a popular agitation had forced the company to move out of west bengal. several other companies followed the tata's to gujarat.

the modi government finished the process of bringing electricity to every village in gujarat that its predecessor had almost completed. modi significantly changed the state's system of power distribution, greatly impacting farmers. gujarat expanded the jyotigram yojana scheme, in which agricultural electricity was separated from other rural electricity; the agricultural electricity was rationed to fit scheduled irrigation demands, reducing its cost. although early protests by farmers ended when those who benefited found that their electricity supply had stabilised, according to an assessment study corporations and large farmers benefited from the policy at the expense of small farmers and labourers.

a contentious debate surrounds the assessment of gujarat's economic development during modi's tenure as chief minister. the state's gdp growth rate averaged 10% during modi's tenure, a value similar to other highly industrialised states, and above that of the country as a whole. gujarat also had a high rate of economic growth in the 1990s, before modi took office, and scholars have stated that growth did not accelerate during modi's tenure. under modi, gujarat topped the world bank's ""ease of doing business"" rankings among indian states for two consecutive years. in 2013, gujarat was ranked first among indian states for ""economic freedom"" by a report measuring governance, growth, citizens' rights and labour and business regulation among the country's 20 largest states. in the later years of modi's government, gujarat's economic growth was frequently used as an argument to counter allegations of communalism. tax breaks for businesses were easier to obtain in gujarat than in other states, as was land. modi's policies to make gujarat attractive for investment included the creation of special economic zones, where labour laws were greatly weakened.

despite its growth rate, gujarat had a relatively poor record on human development, poverty relief, nutrition and education during modi's tenure. in 2013, gujarat ranked 13th in the country with respect to rates of poverty and 21st in education. nearly 45 percent of children under five were underweight and 23 percent were undernourished, putting the state in the ""alarming"" category on the india state hunger index. a study by unicef and the indian government found that gujarat under modi had a poor record with respect to immunisation in children.

over the decade from 2001 to 2011, gujarat did not change its position relative to the rest of the country with respect to poverty and female literacy, remaining near the median of the 29 indian states. it showed only a marginal improvement in rates of infant mortality, and its position with respect to individual consumption declined. with respect to the quality of education in government schools, the state ranked below most indian states. the social policies of the government generally did not benefit muslims, dalits, and adivasis, and generally increased social inequalities. development in gujarat was generally limited to the urban middle class, and citizens in rural areas or from lower castes were increasingly marginalised. in 2013 the state ranked 10th of 21 indian states in the human development index. under modi, the state government spent far less than the national average on education and healthcare.

despite the bjp's shift away from explicit hindutva, modi's election campaign in 2007 and 2012 contained elements of hindu nationalism. modi only attended hindu religious ceremonies, and had prominent associations with hindu religious leaders. during his 2012 campaign he twice refused to wear articles of clothing gifted by muslim leaders. he did, however, maintain relations with dawoodi bohra. his campaign included references to issues known to cause religious polarisation, including to afzal guru and the killing of sohrabuddin sheikh. the bjp did not nominate any muslim candidates for the assembly election of 2012. during the 2012 campaign, modi attempted to identify himself with the state of gujarat, a strategy similar to that used by indira gandhi during the emergency, and projected himself as protecting gujarat against persecution by the rest of india.

while campaigning for the 2012 assembly elections, modi made extensive use of holograms and other technologies allowing him to reach a large number of people, something he would repeat in the 2014 general election. in the 2012 gujarat legislative assembly elections, modi won the constituency of maninagar by 86,373 votes over shweta bhatt, the inc candidate and wife of sanjiv bhatt. the bjp won 115 of the 182 seats, continuing its majority during his tenure and allowing the party to form the government (as it had in gujarat since 1995).
in later by-elections the bjp won four more assembly seats and two lok sabha seats held by the inc, although modi did not campaign for its candidates. in 2013, the wharton india economic forum (wief) at the wharton school of the university of pennsylvania cancelled a keynote video-conference speech by modi following protests by indian-americans. after his election as prime minister, modi resigned as the chief minister and as an mla from maninagar on 21 may 2014. anandiben patel succeeded him as the chief minister.

in september 2013 modi was named the bjp's candidate for prime minister in the 2014 lok sabha election. several bjp leaders expressed opposition to modi's candidature, including bjp founding member l. k. advani, who cited concern with leaders who were ""concerned with their personal agendas"". modi played a dominant role in the bjp's election campaign. several people who voted for the bjp stated that if modi had not been the prime-ministerial candidate, they would have voted for another party. the focus on modi as an individual was unusual for a bjp election campaign. the election was described as a referendum on narendra modi.
during the campaign, modi focused on the corruption scandals under the previous inc government, and played on his image as a politician who had created a high rate of gdp growth in gujarat. modi projected himself as a person who could bring about ""development,"" without focus on any specific policies. his message found support among young indians and among middle-class citizens. the bjp under modi was able to downplay concerns about the protection of religious minorities and modi's commitment to secularism, areas in which he had previously received criticism. prior to the election modi's image in the media had centered around his role in the 2002 gujarat riots, but during the campaign the bjp was able to shift this to a focus on modi's neoliberal ideology and the gujarat model of development, although hindutva remained a significant part of its campaign. the bjp's campaign was assisted by its wide influence in the media. modi's campaign blitz cost approximately , and received extensive financial support from corporate donors. in addition to more conventional campaign methods, modi made extensive use of social media, and addressed more than 1000 rallies via hologram appearances.

the bjp won 31% of the vote, and more than doubled its tally in the lok sabha to 282, becoming the first party to win a majority of seats on its own since 1984. voter dissatisfaction with the inc, as well as with regional parties in north india, was another reason for the success of the bjp, as was the support from the rss. in states such as uttar pradesh in which the bjp performed well, it drew exceptionally high support from upper-caste hindus, although the 10 percent of muslim votes won was more than it had won before. it performed particularly well in parts of the country that had recently experienced violence between hindus and muslims. the magnitude of the bjp's victory led many commentators to say that the election constituted a political realignment away from progressive parties and towards the right-wing. modi's tweet announcing his victory was described as being emblematic of the political realignment away from a secular, socialist state towards capitalism and hindu cultural nationalism.

modi himself was a candidate for the lok sabha in two constituencies: varanasi and vadodara. he won in both constituencies, defeating aam aadmi party leader arvind kejriwal in varanasi and madhusudan mistry of the inc in vadodara by votes. modi, who was unanimously elected leader of the bjp, was appointed prime minister by india's president. to comply with the law that an mp cannot represent more than one constituency, he vacated the vadodara seat.

modi was sworn in as the prime minister of india on 26 may 2014. he became the first prime minister born after india's independence from the british empire. his first year as prime minister saw significant centralisation of power relative to previous administrations. modi's efforts at centralisation have been linked to an increase in the number of senior administration officials resigning their positions. initially lacking a majority in the rajya sabha, or upper house of indian parliament, modi passed a number of ordinances to enact his policies, leading to further centralisation of power. the government also passed a bill increasing the control that it had over the appointment of judges, and reducing that of the judiciary.

in december 2014 modi abolished the planning commission, replacing it with the national institution for transforming india, or niti aayog. the move had the effect of greatly centralising the power previously with the planning commission in the person of the prime minister. the planning commission had received heavy criticism in previous years for creating inefficiency in the government, and of not filling its role of improving social welfare: however, since the economic liberalisation of the 1990s, it had been the major government body responsible for measures related to social justice.

the modi government launched investigations by the intelligence bureau against numerous civil society organisations and foreign non-governmental organisations in the first year of the administration. the investigations, on the grounds that these organisations were slowing economic growth, was criticised as a witchhunt. international humanitarian aid organisation medecins sans frontieres was among the groups that were put under pressure. other organisations affected included the sierra club and avaaz. cases of sedition were filed against individuals criticising the government. this led to discontent within the bjp regarding modi's style of functioning and drew comparisons to the governing style of indira gandhi.

modi repealed 1,200 obsolete laws in first three years as prime minister; a total of 1,301 such laws had been repealed by previous governments over a span of 64 years. he started a monthly radio programme titled ""mann ki baat"" on 3 october 2014. modi also launched the digital india programme, with the goal of ensuring that government services are available electronically, building infrastructure to provide high-speed internet access to rural areas, boosting manufacturing of electronic goods in the country, and promoting digital literacy.

modi launched ujjwala scheme to provide free lpg connection to rural households. the scheme led to an increase in lpg consumption by 56% in 2019 as compared to 2014. in 2019, a law was passed to provide 10% reservation to economically weaker sections.

he was again sworn in as prime minister on 30 may 2019.

the economic policies of modi's government focused on privatisation and liberalisation of the economy, based on a neoliberal framework. modi liberalised india's foreign direct investment policies, allowing more foreign investment in several industries, including in defence and the railways. other proposed reforms included making it harder for workers to form unions and easier for employers to hire and fire them; some of these proposals were dropped after protests. the reforms drew strong opposition from unions: on 2 september 2015, eleven of the country's largest unions went on strike, including one affiliated with the bjp. the bharatiya mazdoor sangh, a constituent of the sangh parivar, stated that the underlying motivation of labour reforms favoured corporations over labourers.

the funds dedicated to poverty reduction programmes and social welfare measures were greatly decreased by the modi administration. the money spent on social programmes declined from 14.6% of gdp during the congress government to 12.6% during modi's first year in office. spending on health and family welfare declined by 15%, and on primary and secondary education by 16%. the budgetary allocation for the sarva shiksha abhiyan, or the ""education for all"" programme, declined by 22%. the government also lowered corporate taxes, abolished the wealth tax, increased sales taxes, and reduced customs duties on gold, and jewellery. in october 2014, the modi government deregulated diesel prices.

in september 2014, modi introduced the make in india initiative to encourage foreign companies to manufacture products in india, with the goal of turning the country into a global manufacturing hub. supporters of economic liberalisation supported the initiative, while critics argued it would allow foreign corporations to capture a greater share of the indian market. modi's administration passed a land-reform bill that allowed it to acquire private agricultural land without conducting a social impact assessment, and without the consent of the farmers who owned it. the bill was passed via an executive order after it faced opposition in parliament, but was eventually allowed to lapse. modi's government put in place the goods and services tax, the biggest tax reform in the country since independence. it subsumed around 17 different taxes and became effective from 1 july 2017.

in his first cabinet decision, modi set up a team to investigate black money. on 9 november 2016, the government demonetised â¹500 and â¹1000 banknotes, with the stated intention of curbing corruption, black money, the use of counterfeit currency, and terrorism. the move led to severe cash shortages, a steep decline in the indian stock indices bse sensex and nifty 50, and sparked widespread protests throughout the country. several deaths were linked to the rush to exchange cash. in the subsequent year, the number of income tax returns filed for individuals rose by 25%, and the number of digital transactions increased steeply.

over the first four years of modi's premiership, india's gdp grew at an average rate of 7.23%, higher than the rate of 6.39% under the previous government. the level of income inequality increased, while an internal government report said that in 2017, unemployment had increased to its highest level in 45 years. the loss of jobs was attributed to the 2016 demonetisation, and to the effects of the goods and services tax.

in his first year as prime minister, modi reduced the amount of money spent by the central government on healthcare. the modi government launched new health policy (nhp) in january 2015. the policy did not increase the government's spending on healthcare, instead emphasising the role of private healthcare organisations. this represented a shift away from the policy of the previous congress government, which had supported programmes to assist public health goals, including reducing child and maternal mortality rates. the national health mission, which included public health programmes targeted at these indices received nearly 20% less funds in 2015 than in the previous year. 15 national health programmes, including those aimed at controlling tobacco use and supporting healthcare for the elderly, were merged with the national health mission. in its budget for the second year after it took office, the modi government reduced healthcare spending by 15%. the healthcare budget for the following year rose by 19%. the budget was viewed positively by private insurance providers. public health experts criticised its emphasis on the role of private healthcare providers, and suggested that it represented a shift away from public health facilities. the healthcare budget rose by 11.5% in 2018; the change included an allocation of 2000 crore for a government-funded health insurance program, and a decrease in the budget of the national health mission. the government introduced stricter packaging laws for tobacco which requires 85% of the packet size to be covered by pictorial warnings. an article in the medical journal ""lancet"" stated that the country ""might have taken a few steps back in public health"" under modi. in 2018 modi launched the ayushman bharat yojana, a government health insurance scheme intended to insure 500 million people. 100,000 people had signed up by october 2018.

modi emphasised his government's efforts at sanitation as a means of ensuring good health. on 2 october 2014, modi launched the swachh bharat abhiyan (""clean india"") campaign. the stated goals of the campaign included eliminating open defecation and manual scavenging within five years. as part of the programme, the indian government began constructing millions of toilets in rural areas and encouraging people to use them. the government also announced plans to build new sewage treatment plants. the administration plans to construct 60 million toilets by 2019. the construction projects have faced allegations of corruption, and have faced severe difficulty in getting people to use the toilets constructed for them. sanitation cover in the country increased from 38.7% in october 2014 to 84.1% in may 2018; however, usage of the new sanitary facilities lagged behind the government's targets. in 2018, the world health organization stated that at least 180,000 diarrhoeal deaths were averted in rural india after the launch of the sanitation effort.

during the 2014 election campaign, the bjp sought to identify itself with political leaders known to have opposed hindu nationalism, including b. r. ambedkar, subhas chandra bose, and ram manohar lohia. the campaign also saw the use of rhetoric based on hindutva by bjp leaders in certain states. communal tensions were played upon especially in uttar pradesh and the states of northeast india. a proposal for the controversial uniform civil code was a part of the bjp's election manifesto.

the activities of a number of hindu nationalist organisations increased in scope after modi's election as prime minister, sometimes with the support of the government. these activities included a hindu religious conversion programme, a campaign against the alleged islamic practice of ""love jihad"", and attempts to celebrate nathuram godse, the assassin of mahatma gandhi, by members of the right wing hindu mahasabha. officials in the government, including the home minister, defended the conversion programmes. modi refused to remove a government minister from her position after a popular outcry resulted from her referring to religious minorities as ""bastards."" commentators have suggested, however, that the violence was perpetrated by radical hindu nationalists to undercut the authority of modi. between 2015 and 2018, human rights watch estimated that 44 people, most of them muslim, were killed by vigilantes; the killings were described by commentators as related to attempts by bjp state governments to ban the slaughter of cows.
links between the bjp and the rss grew stronger under modi. the rss provided organizational support to the bjp's electoral campaigns, while the modi administration appointed a number of individuals affiliated with the rss to prominent government positions. in 2014, yellapragada sudershan rao, who had previously been associated with the rss, chairperson of the indian council of historical research (ichr). historians and former members of the ichr, including those sympathetic to the bjp, questioned his credentials as a historian, and stated that the appointment was part of an agenda of cultural nationalism.

foreign policy played a relatively small role in modi's election campaign, and did not feature prominently in the bjp's election manifesto. modi invited all the other leaders of saarc countries to his swearing in ceremony as prime minister. he was the first indian prime minister to do so.
modi's foreign policy, similarly to that of the preceding inc government, focused on improving economic ties, security, and regional relations. modi continued manmohan singh's policy of ""multi-alignment."" the modi administration tried to attract foreign investment in the indian economy from several sources, especially in east asia, with the use of slogans such as ""make in india"" and ""digital india"". the government also tried to improve relations with islamic nations in the middle east, such as bahrain, iran, saudi arabia, and the united arab emirates, as well as with israel.

during the first few months after the election, modi made trips to a number of different countries to further the goals of his policy, and attended the brics, asean, and g20 summits. one of modi's first visits as prime minister was to nepal, during which he promised a billion usd in aid. modi also made several overtures to the united states, including multiple visits to that country. while this was described as an unexpected development, due to the us having previously denied modi a travel visa over his role during the 2002 gujarat riots, it was also expected to strengthen diplomatic and trade relations between the two countries.

in 2015, the indian parliament ratified a land exchange deal with bangladesh about the indiaâbangladesh enclaves, which had been initiated by the government of manmohan singh. modi's administration gave renewed attention to india's ""look east policy"", instituted in 1991. the policy was renamed the ""act east policy"", and involved directing indian foreign policy towards east asia and southeast asia. the government signed agreements to improve land connectivity with myanmar, through the state of manipur. this represented a break with india's historic engagement with myanmar, which prioritised border security over trade.

india's nominal military spending increased steadily under modi. the military budget declined over modi's tenure both as a fraction of gdp and when adjusted for inflation. a substantial portion of the military budget was devoted to personnel costs, leading commentators to write that the budget was constraining indian military modernisation.

the bjp election manifesto had also promised to deal with illegal immigration into india in the northeast, as well as to be more firm in its handling of insurgent groups. the modi government issued a notification allowing hindu, sikh, and buddhist illegal immigrants from pakistan and bangladesh to legalise their residency in india. the government described the measure as being taken for humanitarian reasons but it drew criticism from several assamese organisations.

the modi administration negotiated a peace agreement with the largest faction of the national socialist council of nagaland (nscm), which was announced in august 2015. the naga insurgency in northeast india had begun in the 1950s. the nscm and the government had agreed to a ceasefire in 1997, but a peace accord had not previously been signed. in 2015 the government abrogated a 15-year ceasefire with the khaplang faction of the nscm (nscm-k). the nscm-k responded with a series of attacks, which killed 18 people. the modi government carried out a raid across the border with myanmar as a result, and labelled the nscm-k a terrorist organisation.

modi promised to be ""tough on pakistan"" during his election campaign, and repeatedly stated that pakistan was an exporter of terrorism. on 29 september 2016, the indian army stated that it had conducted a surgical strike on terror launchpads in azad kashmir. the indian media claimed that up to 50 terrorists and pakistani soldiers had been killed in the strike. pakistan initially denied that any strikes had taken place. subsequent reports suggested that indian claim about the scope of the strike and the number of casualties had been exaggerated, although cross-border strikes had been carried out. in february 2019 india carried out airstrikes in pakistan against a supposed terrorist camp. further military skirmishes followed, including cross-border shelling and the loss of an indian aircraft.

in naming his cabinet, modi renamed the ""ministry of environment and forests"" the ""ministry of environment, forests, and climate change."" in the first budget of the government, the money allotted to this ministry was reduced by more than 50%. the new ministry also removed or diluted a number of laws related to environmental protection. these included no longer requiring clearance from the national board for wildlife for projects close to protected areas, and allowing certain projects to proceed before environmental clearance was received. the government also tried to reconstitute the wildlife board such that it no longer had representatives from non-governmental organisations: however, this move was prevented by the supreme court.

modi also relaxed or abolished a number of other environmental regulations, particularly those related to industrial activity. a government committee stated that the existing system only served to create corruption, and that the government should instead rely on the owners of industries to voluntarily inform the government about the pollution they were creating. other changes included reducing ministry oversight on small mining projects, and no longer requiring approval from tribal councils for projects inside forested areas. in addition, modi lifted a moratorium on new industrial activity in the most polluted areas in the countries. the changes were welcomed by businesspeople, but criticised by environmentalists.

under the upa government that preceded modi's administration, field trials of genetically modified (gm) crops had essentially been put on hold, after protests from farmers fearing for their livelihoods. under the modi government these restrictions were gradually lifted. the government received some criticism for freezing the bank accounts of environmental group greenpeace, citing financial irregularities, although a leaked government report said that the freeze had to do with greenpeace's opposition to gm crops.

in accordance with ghanchi tradition, modi's marriage was arranged by his parents when he was a child. he was engaged at age 13 to jashodaben, marrying her when he was 18. they spent little time together and grew apart when modi began two years of travel, including visits to hindu ashrams. reportedly, their marriage was never consummated, and he kept it a secret because otherwise he could not have become a 'pracharak' in the puritan rashtriya swayamsevak sangh. modi kept his marriage secret for most of his career. he acknowledged his wife for the first time when he filed his nomination for the 2014 general elections. modi maintains a close relationship with his mother, hiraben.

a vegetarian and teetotaler, modi has a frugal lifestyle and is a workaholic and introvert. modi's 31 august 2012 post on google hangouts made him the first indian politician to interact with citizens on a live chat. modi has also been called a fashion-icon for his signature crisply ironed, half-sleeved ""kurta"", as well as for a suit with his name embroidered repeatedly in the pinstripes that he wore during a state visit by us president barack obama, which drew public and media attention and criticism. modi's personality has been variously described by scholars and biographers as energetic, arrogant, and charismatic.

he had published a gujarati book titled ""jyotipunj"" in 2008, containing profiles of various rss leaders. the longest was of m. s. golwalkar, under whose leadership the rss expanded and whom modi refers to as ""pujniya shri guruji"" (""guru worthy of worship""). according to ""the economic times"", his intention was to explain the workings of the rss to his readers and to reassure rss members that he remained ideologically aligned with them. modi authored eight other books, mostly containing short stories for children.

the nomination of modi for the prime ministership drew attention to his reputation as ""one of contemporary india's most controversial and divisive politicians."" during the 2014 election campaign the bjp projected an image of modi as a strong, masculine leader, who would be able to take difficult decisions. campaigns in which he has participated have focused on modi as an individual, in a manner unusual for the bjp and rss. modi has relied upon his reputation as a politician able to bring about economic growth and ""development"". nonetheless, his role in the 2002 gujarat riots continues to attract criticism and controversy. modi's hardline hindutva philosophy and the policies adopted by his government continue to draw criticism, and have been seen as evidence of a majoritarian and exclusionary social agenda.

as a prime minister, modi has received consistently high approval ratings; at the end of his first year in office, he received an overall approval rating of 87% in a pew research poll, with 68% of people rating him ""very favorably"" and 93% approving of his government. his approval rating remained largely consistent at around 74% through his second year in office, according to a nationwide poll conducted by instavaani. at the end of his second year in office, an updated pew research poll showed modi continued to receive high overall approval ratings of 81%, with 57% of those polled rating him ""very favorably."" at the end of his third year in office, a further pew research poll showed modi with an overall approval rating of 88%, his highest yet, with 69% of people polled rating him ""very favorably."" a poll conducted by ""the times of india"" in may 2017 showed 77% of the respondents rated modi as ""very good"" and ""good"". in early 2017, a survey from pew research center showed modi to be the most popular figure in indian politics.

modi was named the best chief minister in a 2007 nationwide survey by ""india today"". in march 2012, he appeared on the cover of the asian edition of ""time magazine"", one of the few indian politicians to have done so. he was awarded indian of the year by ""cnn-ibn"" news network in 2014. in 2014, 2015 and 2017, he was named one of time magazine's 100 most influential people in the world. he was also declared winner of the time magazine reader's poll for person of the year in 2014 and 2016. ""forbes magazine"" ranked him the 15th-most-powerful person in the world in 2014 and the 9th-most-powerful person in the world in 2015, 2016 and 2018. in 2015, modi was ranked the 13th-most-influential person in the world by ""bloomberg markets magazine"". modi was ranked fifth on ""fortune magazine""s first annual list of the ""world's greatest leaders"" in 2015. in 2017, gallup international association (gia) conducted a poll and ranked modi as third top leader of the world. in 2016, a wax statue of modi was unveiled at madame tussaud wax museum in london.

in 2015 he was named one of ""time""s ""30 most influential people on the internet"" as the second-most-followed politician on twitter and facebook. in 2018 he was the third most followed head of the state on twitter, and the most followed world leader on facebook and instagram. in october 2018, modi received un's highest environmental award, the 'champions of the earth', for policy leadership by ""pioneering work in championing"" the international solar alliance and ""new areas of levels of cooperation on environmental action"". he was conferred the 2018 seoul peace prize in recognition of his dedication to improving international co-operation, raising global economic growth, accelerating the human development of the people of india by fostering economic growth and furthering the development of democracy through anti-corruption and social integration efforts. he is the first indian to win the award. in january 2019, ""pm narendra modi"", a biographic film starring vivek oberoi as modi, was announced. 

following his second swearing-in ceremony as prime minister of india, a picture of modi was displayed on the facade of the adnoc building in abu dhabi, united arab emirates. premiered on 12 august 2019, modi appeared in a special episode of discovery channel's show ""man vs wild"" with the host bear grylls, becoming the second world leader after barack obama to appear in the adventure/survival show. in the show he trekked the jungles and talked about nature and wildlife conservation with grylls. the episode was shot in jim corbett national park, uttarakhand and was broadcast in 180 countries along india. the texas india forum hosted a community event in honour of modi on 22 september 2019 at the nrg stadium in houston, texas. the event was attended by over 50,000 people and several american politicians including president donald trump, making it the largest gathering for an invited foreign leader visiting the united states other than the pope. at the same event, modi was presented with the key to the city of houston by mayor sylvester turner. he was awarded the global goalkeeper award on 24 september 2019 in new york city by the bill & melinda gates foundation in recognition for the swachh bharat mission and ""the progress india has made in providing safe sanitation under his leadership"".
"
leonardo dicaprio,"
leonardo wilhelm dicaprio (, ; born november 11, 1974) is an american actor, producer, and environmentalist. he is known for starring in biopics and period films, and for playing unconventional roles. his films have earned $7.2 billion worldwide, and he has ranked eight times in annual rankings of the world's highest-paid actors. his accolades include an academy award and three golden globe awards.

born in los angeles, dicaprio began his career by appearing in television commercials in the late 1980s. in the early 1990s, he played recurring roles in various television series, such as the soap opera ""parenthood"". he had his first major film role in ""this boy's life"", and received acclaim for the supporting role of a developmentally disabled boy in ""what's eating gilbert grape"" (both 1993), which earned him an academy award nomination. he achieved international fame as a star in the epic romance ""titanic"" (1997), which became the highest-grossing film to that point. after a brief setback, dicaprio starred in two critically acclaimed films in 2002: the biographical crime drama ""catch me if you can"" and the historical drama ""gangs of new york"", which marked his first of many collaborations with director martin scorsese.

dicaprio subsequently earned nominations for the academy award for best actor for the roles of howard hughes in ""the aviator"" (2004) and a mercenary in the political thriller ""blood diamond"" (2006), and also received acclaim for his roles in the crime drama ""the departed"" (2006) and the romantic drama ""revolutionary road"" (2008). in the 2010s, he starred in the psychological thriller ""shutter island"" (2010), the science fiction thriller ""inception"" (2010), the western ""django unchained"" (2012), the romantic drama ""the great gatsby"" (2013), the biopic ""the wolf of wall street"" (2013), the survival drama ""the revenant"" (2015)âfor which he earned an academy award and a bafta award for best actor in a leading roleâand the comedy-drama ""once upon a time in hollywood"" (2019).

dicaprio is the founder of the production company appian way productions, which has produced some of his own films and the television show, ""greensburg"" (2008â2010). he is also the founder of the leonardo dicaprio foundation, a non-profit organization devoted to promoting environmental awareness. he regularly supports charitable causes, and has produced several documentaries on environment. in 2005, he was named the commander of the ordre des arts et des lettres for his contributions to the arts, and in 2016, he was listed as one of the 100 most influential people in the world by ""time"" magazine.

leonardo wilhelm dicaprio was born on november 11, 1974 in los angeles, california, the only child of irmelin (nã©e indenbirken), a legal secretary, and george dicaprio, an underground comix artist and producer and distributor of comic books. dicaprio's father is of italian and german descent, and the actor is hence conversant in italian. dicaprio's maternal grandfather, wilhelm indenbirken, was german. his maternal grandmother, helene indenbirken was a russian-born german citizen. in an interview in russia, dicaprio referred to himself as ""half-russian"" and said that two of his late grandparents were russian. dicaprio's parents met while attending college and subsequently moved to los angeles.
dicaprio was named leonardo because his pregnant mother was looking at a leonardo da vinci painting in the uffizi museum in florence, italy, when he first kicked. his parents separated when he was a year old; while he lived mostly with his mother, his parents agreed to live next door so as not to deprive dicaprio of his father's presence in his life. dicaprio and his mother lived in several los angeles neighborhoods, such as echo park and los feliz, while his mother worked several jobs. he attended seeds elementary school and john marshall high school a few blocks away, after attending the los angeles center for enriched studies for four years. dicaprio has said he hated attending public school, and often asked his mother to take him to auditions instead to improve their financial situation. he dropped out of high school following his third year, eventually earning his general equivalency diploma (ged).

dicaprio has said his career choice as a child was to become a marine biologist or an actor, but he eventually favored the latter, as he was fond of impersonating characters and imitating people. when he was two, he went to a performance festival with his family where he went up on stage and started dancing, which entertained the crowd and he loved the attention. when his older stepbrother adam farrar earned a check of $50,000 for a television commercial, dicaprio, fascinated with this, also decided to become an actor. in 1979, dicaprio was removed, at the age of five, from the set of the children's television series ""romper room"" for being disruptive. he began appearing in several commercials at age 14 for matchbox cars by mattel, which he considered his first role, and later for kraft foods, bubble yum, and apple jacks. in 1989, he played the role of glen in two episodes of the television show ""the new lassie"".

in the beginning of his career, dicaprio had difficulty finding an agent. one agent suggested he change his name to lenny williams to appeal to the american audience, which he refused. he remained jobless for a year and a half even after 100 auditions. disillusioned at this, he initially decided to quit acting, but his father encouraged him not to give up. by the early 1990s, he began acting regularly on television, starting with a role in the pilot of ""the outsiders"" (1990) and one episode of the soap opera ""santa barbara"" (1990), in which he played the young mason capwell. dicaprio got a break that year when he was cast in ""parenthood"", a series based on a successful comedy film by the same name. before he was cast in the role of garry buckman, a troubled teenager, he analyzed joaquin phoenix's performance in the original film. his works that year earned him two nominations at the 12th youth in film awardsâbest young actor in a daytime series for ""santa barbara"" and best young actor starring in a new television series for ""parenthood"". dicaprio was also a celebrity contestant on the children's game show ""fun house"". one of the stunts he performed on the show was going fishing in a small pool of water by catching the fish only with his teeth.

in 1991, dicaprio played an un-credited role in one episode of ""roseanne"". his film debut came later that year in the low-budget horror direct-to-video film ""critters 3"", in which he played the stepson of an evil landlord, a role he described as ""your average, no-depth, standard kid with blond hair."" dicaprio prefers not to remember his role in ""critters 3"", which he describes as ""possibly one of the worst films of all time. i guess it was a good example to look back and make sure it doesn't happen again"". later that year, he became a recurring cast member on the successful abc sitcom ""growing pains"", playing luke brower, a homeless boy who is taken in by the seaver family. costar joanna kerns recalls dicaprio being ""especially intelligent and disarming for his age"" but also mischievous on set. a teenage dicaprio was cast by the producers to appeal to the younger female audiences, but the show's ratings did not improve and he left it soon after. he was nominated for a young artist award for best young actor co-starring in a television series.
in 1992, dicaprio played a supporting role in the first installment of the ""poison ivy"" film series, and was handpicked by robert de niro out of 400 young actors to play the lead role in michael caton-jones's ""this boy's life"". he played opposite de niro, who was acting as his stepfather, and ellen barkin as his mother. caton-jones has said dicaprio did not know how to behave on set; he subsequently applied a strict mentoring style and was satisfied with how dicaprio changed after filming finished. bilge ebiri of ""rolling stone"" found it ""an evocative, touching little movie, defined by the powerful bond between barkin and dicaprio"", praising his complex growth from ""a wide-eyed son to a rebellious greaser to an independent, sensitive young man"".

in 1993, dicaprio co-starred as the mentally handicapped brother of johnny depp's character in ""what's eating gilbert grape"", a comic-tragic odyssey of a dysfunctional iowa family. director lasse hallstrã¶m admitted he was initially looking for a less good-looking actor, but cast dicaprio when he contacted caton-jones and he had emerged as ""the most observant actor"" among all who auditioned. the film became a critical success, resulting in various accolades for dicaprio, including a national board of review award and nominations for an academy award and a golden globe award for best supporting actor. ""the new york times"" critic janet maslin wrote, ""the film's real show-stopping turn comes from mr. dicaprio, who makes arnie's many tics so startling and vivid that at first he is difficult to watch. the performance has a sharp, desperate intensity from beginning to end."" caryn james, also writing for ""the new york times"", said of his performances in ""this boy's life"" and ""what's eating gilbert grape"": ""he made the raw, emotional neediness of those boys completely natural and powerful.""

dicaprio's first effort of 1995 was sam raimi's ""the quick and the dead"", a western film. sony pictures was dubious over dicaprio's casting, and as a result, costar sharon stone paid his salary herself. the film was released to a dismal box office performance, barely grossing us$18.5 million in the us, and received mixed reviews from critics. dicaprio next starred alongside david thewlis in agnieszka holland's ""total eclipse"", a fictionalized account of the homosexual relationship between arthur rimbaud (dicaprio) and paul verlaine (thewlis). he replaced river phoenix, who died before filming began. the film grossed only $0.34 million against its â¬6-million budget. dicaprio's last film in 1995 was ""the basketball diaries"", a biopic, in which he played jim carroll in his teenage years as a drug-addicted high school basketball player and writer.

in 1996, dicaprio appeared opposite claire danes in baz luhrmann's film ""romeo + juliet"", an abridged modernization of william shakespeare's romantic tragedy of the same name, which retained the original shakespearean dialogue. the project achieved a worldwide box office take of $147 million, and earned dicaprio a silver bear for best actor at the 1997 berlin international film festival. later that year, he starred in ""marvin's room"", a family drama revolving around two sisters, played by meryl streep and diane keaton, who are reunited through tragedy after 17 years of estrangement. dicaprio portrayed hank, streep's character's troubled son, who has been committed to a mental asylum.

dicaprio turned down an offer to do the film ""boogie nights"" (1997) to star alongside kate winslet in james cameron's ""titanic"" (1997) as members of different social classes who fall in love aboard rms ""titanic"" during its ill-fated maiden voyage. dicaprio initially refused to play the character, but was eventually encouraged to pursue the role by cameron, who strongly believed in his acting ability. with a production budget of more than $200 million, the film was the most expensive ever made and was filmed at rosarito beach where a replica of the ship was created. against expectations, ""titanic"" went on to become the highest-grossing film to that point, eventually grossing more than $2.1 billion in box-office receipts worldwide, and transformed dicaprio into a superstar, resulting in intense adoration among teenage girls and young women in general that became known as ""leo-mania."" the film won 11 academy awardsâthe most for any filmâincluding best picture, but dicaprio's failure to gain a nomination led to a protest against the academy of motion picture arts and sciences by more than 200 fans. he was nominated for other high-profile awards, including a golden globe award for best actor. 
upon the success of ""titanic"", dicaprio stated in 2000: ""i have no connection with me during that whole ""titanic"" phenomenon and what my face became around the world [...] i'll never reach that state of popularity again, and i don't expect to. it's not something i'm going to try to achieve either."" john hiscock of ""the daily telegraph"" compared dicaprio's popularity during that time to that of the beatles' in the 1960s. bilge ebiri called his role in the film his best, writing that dicaprio and winslet ""infuse their earnest back-and-forth with so much genuine emotion that it's hard not to get swept up in their doomed love affair"".

dicaprio played a self-mocking role in a small appearance in woody allen's caustic satire of the fame industry, ""celebrity"" (1998) whom bilge ebiri labelled ""the best thing in the film"". that year, he also starred in the dual roles of the villainous king louis xiv and his secret, sympathetic twin brother philippe in randall wallace's ""the man in the iron mask"", based on the same-titled 1939 film. the film received mixed to negative response, but became a box office success, grossing $180 million internationally. ""entertainment weekly"" critic owen gleiberman wrote that dicaprio did not look old enough to play the part, but praised him as ""a fluid and instinctive actor, with the face of a mischievous angel""; the actor was awarded a golden raspberry award for worst screen couple for both incarnations the following year.

dicaprio was cast in ""american psycho"" (2000) in 1998 for a reported salary of $20 million, but left the project soon after when he failed to agree with oliver stone on the film's direction and favored the lead role in ""the beach"" instead. the latter, an adaption of alex garland's 1996 novel of the same name, saw him play an american backpacking tourist looking for the perfect way of life in a secret island commune in the gulf of thailand. budgeted at $50 million, the film earned about three times more at the box office, but was negatively reviewed by critics, and earned him a nomination for the golden raspberry award for worst actor. todd mccarthy of ""variety"" noted that his character is ""too much the american everyman"" that lacks individuality, and ""dicaprio, while perfectly watchable,"" failed to give the character the unique marks to make him dimensional.

in the mid 1990s, dicaprio appeared in the mostly improvised short film called ""don's plum"", as a favor to aspiring director r. d. robb. when robb decided to expand the black-and-white film to feature length, dicaprio and co-star tobey maguire had its release blocked by court order, arguing that they never intended to make it a theatrical release, as it would have commercial value thanks to their stardom. the film eventually premiered at the 2001 berlin international film festival, where it was well received by critics.

dicaprio's first film of 2002 was martin scorsese's ""gangs of new york"", a historical drama set in the mid-19th century in the five points district of new york city. director scorsese initially struggled selling his idea of realizing the film until dicaprio became interested in playing protagonist amsterdam vallon, a young leader of the irish faction, and thus, miramax films got involved with financing the project. nonetheless production on the film was plagued by blown-out budgets and producer-director squabbles, resulting in a marathon eight-month shoot and, at $103 million, the most expensive film scorsese had ever made. ""gangs of new york"" earned a total of $193 million worldwide and received mostly positive reviews. dicaprio's performance, although well-received, was overshadowed by that of daniel day-lewis' according to most critics.

also in 2002, dicaprio appeared in the biographical crime drama film ""catch me if you can"", based on the life of frank abagnale jr., who, before his 19th birthday committed check fraud to make millions in the 1960s. directed by steven spielberg, the film was shot in 147 different locations in only 52 days, making it ""the most adventurous, super-charged movie-making"" dicaprio had experienced yet. the film received favorable reviews and proved to be an international success, becoming dicaprio's highest-grossing release since ""titanic"" with a total of us$351 million worldwide. roger ebert praised his performance, and found his departure from dark and troubled characters ""breezy and charming"". dicaprio received his third golden globe nomination for his work in the film.

in 2004, dicaprio founded the production company appian way productions, taking its name from the italian road of the same name. he was interested to find ""out of the box"" material from an perspective and develop it that way from the original source work. he said, ""a lot of times, i'd gone through the process of getting a great book or finding a great story, and then too many people get their hands on it and it turns into something entirely different. it is very difficult to reverse that process."" dicaprio's first producing task was as an executive producer in niels mueller' ""the assassination of richard nixon"", starring sean penn as samuel byck, who attempted to assassinate us president richard nixon in 1974. it was screened in the un certain regard section at the 2004 cannes film festival. dicaprio and scorsese reunited for a biopic of the eccentric and obsessive american film director and aviation pioneer howard hughes in ""the aviator"" (2004), which he also co-produced under appian way. centering on hughes' life from the late 1920s to 1947, dicaprio initially developed the project with michael mann, who decided against directing it after working on back-to-back biopics; ""the insider"" (1999) and ""ali"" (2001). the actor eventually pitched john logan's script to scorsese, who quickly signed on to direct. ""the aviator"" became a critical and financial success. simond braund of ""empire"" wrote dicaprio stood out in scenes depicting hughes' paranoia and obsession, ""dispelling fears that he hasn't the weight to carry such a complex, forceful role"". he won a golden globe award for best actor and received his first academy award for best actor nomination.

in 2006, dicaprio starred in the political war thriller ""blood diamond"" and the crime film ""the departed"". in scorsese's ""the departed"" dicaprio played the role of billy costigan, a state trooper working undercover in an irish mob in boston, someone he characterizes as in a ""constant, 24-hour panic attack"". dicaprio especially liked the experience of working with costar jack nicholson, describing a scene with him ""one of the most memorable moments"" of his life as an actor. in preparation, dicaprio visited boston to interact with people associated with the irish mob and gained of muscle. highly anticipated, the film was released to positive reviews and became one of the highest-rated wide release films of 2006. peter travers of ""rolling stone"" praised dicaprio's and costar matt damon's ""explosive, emotionally complex performances"", but felt that nicholson overshadowed the two. budgeted at $90 million, the film grossed $291 million and emerged as dicaprio and scorsese's highest-grossing collaboration to date.
in edward zwick's war film ""blood diamond"", he starred as a diamond smuggler from rhodesia who is involved in the sierra leone civil war. for the role, dicaprio spent six months in africa, learned about camouflage from people in south african military and interviewed and recorded people in the country to improve his south african accent. the film received generally favorable reviews, and dicaprio was praised for the authenticity of his south african accent, known as a difficult accent to imitate. claudia puig of the ""usa today"" called it ""the first time the boyish actor has truly seemed like a man on film"" and ann hornaday of the ""washington post"" positively noted his growth as an actor since his performance in ""the departed"". both the golden globes and the screen actors guild nominated dicaprio twice in the best actor category for both of his 2006 features, and dicaprio earned his third academy award nomination for ""blood diamond"". his performance in ""the departed"" also earned him a satellite award for best supporting actor.

in 2007, dicaprio produced the comedy drama ""gardener of eden"" (2007), which, according to ""the hollywood reporter"" frank scheck, ""lack[ed] the necessary dramatic urgency or black humor to connect with audiences"". shortly after saw the release of ""the 11th hour"", a documentary about people's relationship to nature and global warming, which he created, produced, co-written and narrated. it won the earthwatch environmental film award through the national geographic channel in march 2008.

in 2008, dicaprio starred in ""body of lies"", a spy film based on the novel of the same name by david ignatius, set in context of the middle east and the war on terror, telling the story of three men battling a terrorist organization, and each other. dicaprio dyed his hair brown and wore brown contacts for the role, which he chose to pursue because he considered it a throwback to political films of the 1970s like ""the parallax view"" (1974) and ""three days of the condor"" (1975). the film received mixed reviews from critics, and at a budget of $67.5 million, became a moderate box office success, grossing $115 million worldwide. later that year, dicaprio reunited with kate winslet to film the drama ""revolutionary road"" (2008), directed by winslet's then-husband sam mendes. as both actors had been reluctant to make romantic films similar to ""titanic"", it was winslet who suggested that both should work with her on a film adaptation of the 1961 novel of the same name by richard yates after reading the script by justin haythe, knowing that plot had little in common with the 1997 blockbuster. once dicaprio agreed to the film, it went almost immediately into production. he noted that he saw his character as ""unheroic"" and ""slightly cowardly"" and that he was ""willing to be just a product of his environment."" playing a couple in a failing marriage in the 1950s, dicaprio and winslet spent some time together in preparation, and dicaprio felt claustrophobic on the small set they used. marshall sella of ""gq"" called it the ""most mature and memorable performance of his lifetime""; dicaprio earned his seventh golden globes nomination for the film. 

also in 2008, dicaprio was a creator and an executive producer for ""greensburg"" an american television series broadcast on the planet green television network. the show takes place in greensburg, kansas, and is about rebuilding the town in a sustainable way after being hit by the may 2007 ef5 tornado, and ran for three seasons until 2010. he ended the 2000s by producing the psychological horror thriller film jaume collet-serra's ""orphan"" (2009), starring vera farmiga, peter sarsgaard and isabelle fuhrman. the plot centers on a couple who, after the death of their unborn child, adopt a mysterious 9-year-old girl. the film was considered by the adoption community to promote negative stereotypes about orphans. although the film received mixed reviews, it was a commercial success.

dicaprio continued his collaborative streak with scorsese in the 2010 psychological thriller film ""shutter island"" (2010), based on the 2003 novel of the same name by dennis lehane. he played edward ""teddy"" daniels, a u.s. marshal investigating a psychiatric facility located on an island, but comes to question his own sanity. dicaprio and scorsese quickly drew toward the project in 2007, and the former co-produced the film under appian way with phoenix pictures. filming proved to be a traumatic experience for dicaprio, as he had nightmares of mass murder during production. the film was released to mixed reviews; peter bradshaw of ""the guardian"" praised the direction and performances but criticized its ""silly twist ending"", calling it ""supremely exasperating"". peter travers called it dicaprio's ""most haunting and emotionally complex performance yet"", and particularly liked his cave scene with costar patricia clarkson. the film was a commercial success, grossing $294 million worldwide.

also in 2010, dicaprio starred in director christopher nolan's ensemble science-fiction film ""inception"". inspired by the experience of lucid dreaming and dream incubation, the film features dicaprio's character, dom cobb, an ""extractor"" who enters the dreams of others to obtain information that is otherwise inaccessible. cobb is promised a chance to regain his old life in exchange for planting an idea in a corporate target's mind. dicaprio was ""intrigued by this conceptâthis dream-heist notion and how this character's gonna unlock his dreamworld and ultimately affect his real life."" released to critical acclaim, ""inception"" grossed over $825 million worldwide to become dicaprio's second highest-grossing film. to star in this film, dicaprio agreed to a pay cut from his $20 million fee, in favor of splitting first-dollar gross points, which means he receives money coming directly off the top of ticket sales. this risk paid off, as dicaprio earned $50 million from the film to become his highest payday yet.

after playing demanding roles in ""shutter island"" and ""inception"", dicaprio took break from acting, as he wanted some time for himself. in 2011, he starred alongside armie hammer and naomi watts in clint eastwood's ""j. edgar"", a biopic about j. edgar hoover. the film focuses on the career of the fbi director from the palmer raids onwards, including an examination of his private life as an alleged closeted homosexual. reviews toward the film were mostly mixed; critics commended dicaprio's performance but felt that, overall, the film lacked coherence. roger ebert praised dicaprio's ""fully-realized, subtle and persuasive performance, hinting at more than hoover ever revealed, perhaps even to himself."" also in 2011, he produced catherine hardwicke's romantic horror film ""red riding hood"", which is very loosely based movie on the folk tale ""little red riding hood"". although it was poorly received by criticsâmary pols of ""time"" named it one of the top 10 worst movies of 2011âit had moderate box-office returns. he was also an executive producer for george clooney's political drama ""the ides of march"", an adaptation of beau willimon's 2008 play ""farragut north"".

in 2012, dicaprio starred as a plantation owner calvin candie in quentin tarantino's spaghetti western, ""django unchained"". after reading the script, dicaprio was initially uncomfortable with the extent of racism portrayed in the film, but his costars and tarantino eventually convinced him not to extenuate it. while filming, dicaprio accidentally cut his hand on glass, but continued filming, and tarantino elected to use the take in the final movie. the film received positive reviews from critics; a writer for ""wired"" commended him for playing a villainous role and his ""blood-chilling"" performance. the film earned dicaprio his ninth nomination at the golden globes. ""django unchained"" grossed $424 million worldwide on a production budget of $100 million.

dicaprio's next role was as the millionaire jay gatsby in baz luhrmann's ""the great gatsby"" (2013), an adaptation of f. scott fitzgerald's 1925 novel of same name, costarring carey mulligan and tobey maguire. dicaprio was attracted to the idea of playing a man with nothing who makes himself solely based on his imaginations and that can be interpreted in several ways: ""a hopeless romantic, a completely obsessed wacko or a dangerous gangster, clinging to wealth"". it received mixed reviews from critics, but dicaprio's portrayal was praised, and earned him an aacta award for best actor in a leading role. critic rafer guzman of ""newsday"" praised dicaprio as not only ""tough [...] but also vulnerable, touching, funny, a faker, a human. it's a tremendous, hard-won performance."" matt zoller seitz of roger ebert's website described his performance as ""the movie's greatest and simplest special effect,"" and ""iconicâmaybe his career best."" the film grossed $348 million worldwide.

three films were produced by dicaprio under appian way in 2013âthe ensemble crime thriller ""runner runner"", which ""the guardian"" xan brooks described as ""a lazy, trashy film that barely goes through the motions""; the thriller ""out of the furnace"", a critical and commercial failure; and the black comedy-drama ""the wolf of wall street"". dicaprio reunited with scorsese for the fifth time in ""the wolf of wall street"", a film based on the life of stockbroker jordan belfort (played by dicaprio), who was arrested in the late 1990s for securities fraud and money laundering. dicaprio wanted to play belfort ever since he had read his autobiography and won a bidding war with warner bros. against brad pitt/paramount pictures for the rights to belfort's memoir in 2007. he was fond of belfort's honest and unapologetic portrayal of his actual experiences in the book, and was inspired by the financial crisis of 2007â2008 to make the film. ""the wolf of wall street"" received mostly positive reviews for its direction and the comedic portrayal of dicaprio. in his review for ""the hollywood reporter"", todd mccarthy wrote of his ""largest and best screen performance, one in which he lets loose as he never has before, is not protective of vanity or a sense of cool and, one feels, gets completely to the bottom of his character"" and praised him for playing his role without any caution. the film earned him a golden globe award for best actor in a musical or comedy and nominations for the academy award for best actor and best picture. in january 2013, dicaprio said he was going to take a long break from acting and would ""fly around the world doing good for the environment.""

dicaprio was an executive producer on ""virunga"", a 2014 british documentary film about four people fighting to protect the world's last mountain gorillas from war and poaching. the film premiered at the tribeca film festival on april 17, 2014.

in 2015, dicaprio produced and played fur trapper hugh glass in alejandro g. iã±ã¡rritu's survival drama ""the revenant"". dicaprio has described it his most difficult film. he had to eat a raw slab of bison's liver and sleep in animal carcasses, and suffered hypothermia. he also learned to shoot a musket, build a fire, speak two native american languages (pawnee and arikara) and ancient healing techniques. built on a budget of $135 million, the film earned $533 million worldwide. it was also well received by critics, and dicaprio's performance garnered universal acclaim; mark kermode of ""the guardian"" wrote of dicaprio's ""brainstorming"" portrayal and ""his turn to triumph with a performance which relies more upon physicality than the spoken word"", and nick de semlyen of ""empire"" noted his ""raw performance helps elevate what could have been just another man-versus-nature drama"". the film earned him numerous awards, including an academy award, a golden globe, a bafta, an sag and a critic's choice award for best actor. also in 2015, he was an executive producer for ""catching the sun"", a documentary film on the growth of the solar power industry that premiered on netflix in april 2016.

after narrating the 2019 global warming documentary ""ice on fire"", dicaprio returned to acting after four years in quentin tarantino's comedy-drama ""once upon a time in hollywood"", which traces the relationship between rick dalton (dicaprio), an aging television actor and his stuntman, cliff booth (brad pitt). to help the film's financing, dicaprio and pitt agreed to take a pay cut, and they each received $10 million. dicaprio liked the experience of working with pitt; tarantino described the pair as ""the most exciting star dynamic duo"" since robert redford and paul newman. dicaprio was fascinated with the film's homage to hollywood and focus on the friendship between his and pitt's characters. for his role, dicaprio drew from real-life experience of witnessing the struggles and rejections of his actor friends in the industry. reviews for the film and dicaprio's performance were positive; a critic for business insider called it the best performance of his career and ian sandwell of digital spy particularly liked dicaprio's and pitt's ""easy"" chemistry, which he said helps bring authenticity to their characters' connection. the film earned a total of $357 million against its $90-million budget.

early in his career, dicaprio gained a reputation for his intense partying with his male friends. dicaprio said people's perception of him was exaggerated, adding, ""they want you miserable, just like them. they don't want heroes; what they want is to see you fall"". in 1998, he sued ""playgirl"" magazine over plans to publish a fully nude picture of him. ""the new york times"" caryn james has since credited dicaprio for being one of the few actors to turn his success into ""a new form of old-fashioned hollywood stardom that uses celebrity to advance social causes yet rarely lets the public beyond the glittering veil of the photo op"". carole cadwalla of ""the guardian"" says dicaprio is ""polite, charming, makes jokes, engages eye contact. and manages [...] to give almost no hint whatsoever of his actual personality"".
dicaprio is considered one of the most talented actors of his generation. as he achieved international stardom after ""titanic"" (1997), it intensified his image as a teen idol and romantic lead, both of which he sought to dissociate himself from. he has said he feels nervous starring in big-budget studio films due to their hype and marketing campaign. as an actor, he likes to look at film as a ""relevant art form, like a painting or sculpture. a hundred years from now, people will still be watching that movie"". he is drawn to parts based on real people, and stories told in specific periods. according to caryn james, dicaprio is unafraid of working on ""offbeat projects by first-rate directors"", a risk that has led to ""misbegotten"" projects like ""the beach"" (2000), but also his most notable collaborations with martin scorsese on several projects. dicaprio describes his relationship with the director as ""pretty much a dream come true for me"", and admires his knowledge of cinema, crediting him for teaching him the history and importance of cinema. scorsese, on his part, has said, ""leo will give me the emotion where i least expect it and could only hope for in about three or four scenes. and he can do it take after take."" jesse hassenger of ""the a.v. club"" believes both artists have benefited from the projects, which have helped define their careers in the 2000s.

agnieszka holland, who directed dicaprio in ""total eclipse"" (1995), describes dicaprio as ""one of the most mature actors i've ever worked with"", and admires his ""courageous"" roles choice. she says he does not apply method acting, but is ""doing some trick which is pretty mysterious to everyone watching â frankly even for the director. look at him on screen and, for the moment of the shot, he really becomes the character."" late film critic philip french, writing for ""the observer"", called dicaprio a ""superb actor who hasn't yet quite become an adult"", and identified a theme of characters in the process of becoming a man. he wrote that dicaprio's inclination toward films about dysfunctional families and characters seeking a father figure allude to his own troubled childhood. dicaprio often plays characters who themselves are playing roles, which according to caryn james ""looks simple on screen but is immensely sophisticated"". he tends to play antiheroes and characters that go crazy as the narrative progresses. dicaprio is particularly known for his ability to heavily commit to each role he plays; colin covert of ""the seattle times"" notes how this quality sets him apart from most of his contemporaries and ""redefines film stardom"".

several media outlets have included dicaprio in their beauty lists, such as ""people"", ""empire"", and ""harper's bazaar"". he has said he does not believe in the appeal, as it is only temporary and can negatively affect one's career, looking for career longevity instead. in 2005, dicaprio was made a commander of the ""ordre des arts et des lettres"" by the french minister of culture for his contributions to the arts. in 2016, he was named one of the 100 most influential people in the world by the ""time"" magazine. he was included in ""forbes"" annual list of highest-paid actors in 2008 and from 2010 to 2016 with respective earnings of $45 million, $28 million, $77 million, $37 million, $39 million, $29 million and $27 million, topping the list in 2011. the magazine praised dicaprio's ability to star in risky, r-rated films that become box-office hits. ""the hollywood reporter"" tatiana siegel credits dicaprio for being a rare actor to have a successful career ""without ever having made a comic book movie, family film or pre-branded franchise. leo is the franchise"". stacey wilson hunt, analyzing his career in ""new york"" magazine in 2016, noted dicaprio, unlike most of his contemporaries, had not starred in a failed film in the past ten years.

according to the online portal box office mojo and the review aggregate site rotten tomatoes, dicaprio's most critically and commercially successful films include ""what's eating gilbert grape"" (1993), ""titanic"" (1997), ""catch me if you can"" (2002), ""gangs of new york"" (2002), ""the aviator"" (2004), ""the departed"" (2006), ""blood diamond"" (2006), ""inception"" (2010), ""django unchained"" (2012), ""the wolf of wall street"" (2013), ""the revenant"" (2015) and ""once upon a time in hollywood"" (2019). his films have grossed a total of $7.2 billion worldwide.

dicaprio has been recognized by the academy of motion picture arts and sciences for the following performances:
dicaprio has won three golden globe awards: best actor â motion picture drama for ""the aviator"" and ""the revenant"" and best actor â motion picture musical or comedy for ""the wolf of wall street"", and a bafta award for best actor in a leading role for ""the revenant"".
"
andre agassi,"
andre kirk agassi ( ; born april 29, 1970) is an american retired professional tennis player and former world no. 1 whose career spanned from the late 1980s to the early 2000s. in singles, agassi is an eight-time grand slam champion and a 1996 olympic gold medalist, as well as being a runner-up in seven other grand slam tournaments. during the open era, agassi was the first male player to win four australian open titles, a record that was later surpassed by novak djokovic when he won his fifth title in 2015, and then by roger federer in 2017. agassi is one of five male singles players to achieve the career grand slam in the open era and one of eight in history, the first of two to achieve the career golden slam (career grand slam and olympic gold medal, the other being rafael nadal), and the only man to win the career golden slam and the atp tour world championships: a distinction dubbed as a ""career super slam"" by ""sports illustrated"".

agassi was the first male player to win all four grand slam tournaments on three different surfaces (hard, clay and grass), and the last american male to win both the french open (in 1999) and the australian open (in 2003). he also won 17 atp masters series titles and was part of the winning davis cup teams in 1990, 1992 and 1995. agassi reached the world no. 1 ranking for the first time in 1995 but was troubled by personal issues during the mid-to-late 1990s and sank to no. 141 in 1997, prompting many to believe that his career was over. agassi returned to no. 1 in 1999 and enjoyed the most successful run of his career over the next four years. during his 20-plus year tour career, agassi was known by the nickname ""the punisher"".

after suffering from sciatica caused by two bulging discs in his back, a spondylolisthesis (vertebral displacement) and a bone spur that interfered with the nerve, agassi retired from professional tennis on september 3, 2006, after losing in the third round of the us open to benjamin becker. he is the founder of the andre agassi charitable foundation, which has raised over $60â million for at-risk children in southern nevada. in 2001, the foundation opened the andre agassi college preparatory academy in las vegas, a k-12 public charter school for at-risk children. he has been married to fellow tennis player steffi graf since 2001.

andre agassi was born in las vegas, nevada to emmanuel ""mike"" agassi, a former olympic boxer from iran and elizabeth ""betty"" agassi (nã©e dudley). his father is of armenian and assyrian heritage. one of his ancestors changed his surname from armenian aghassian to less noticeable agassi as ""a skin-saving measure during a time when turks frequently used armenians for target practice"". andre agassi's mother, betty, is a breast cancer survivor. he has three older siblings â rita (last wife to pancho gonzales), philip and tami. andre was given the middle name kirk after kirk kerkorian, an armenian american billionaire. agassi, a waiter at tropicana las vegas, met kerkorian in 1963.

agassi at the age of 12 (with his good friend and doubles partner roddy parks) won the 1982 national indoor boys 14s doubles championship in chicago. agassi describes more of his memorable experiences and juvenile pranks with roddy in his book ""open"".

at the age of 13, agassi was sent to nick bollettieri's tennis academy in florida. he was meant to stay for only three months, because that was all his father could afford. after thirty minutes of watching agassi play, bollettieri, deeply impressed by his talent, called mike and said: ""take your check back. he's here for free."" agassi then dropped out of school in the ninth grade to pursue a full-time tennis career.

agassi turned professional at the age of 16 and competed in his first tournament at la quinta, california. he won his first match against john austin, but then lost his second match to mats wilander. by the end of 1986, agassi was ranked no. 91. he won his first top-level singles title in 1987 at the sul american open in itaparica and ended the year ranked no. 25. he won six additional tournaments in 1988 (memphis, u.s. men's clay court championships, forest hills wct, stuttgart outdoor, volvo international and livingston open), and, by december of that year, he had surpassed us$1â million in career prize money after playing in just 43 tournamentsâthe fastest anyone in history had reached that level. during 1988, he also set the open-era record for most consecutive victories by a male teenager (a record that stood for 17 years until rafael nadal broke it in 2005). his year-end ranking was no. 3, behind second-ranked ivan lendl and top-ranked mats wilander. both the association of tennis professionals and ""tennis"" magazine named agassi the most improved player of the year for 1988.

in addition to not playing the australian open (which later became his best grand slam event) for the first eight years of his career, agassi chose not to play at wimbledon from 1988 through 1990 and publicly stated that he did not wish to play there because of the event's traditionalism, particularly its ""predominantly white"" dress code to which players at the event are required to conform.

strong performances on the tour meant that agassi was quickly tipped as a future grand slam champion. while still a teenager, he reached the semifinals of both the french open and the us open in 1988 and made the us open semifinals in 1989. he began the 1990s with a series of near-misses. he reached his first grand slam final in 1990 at the french open, where he was favored before losing in four sets to andrã©s gã³mez, which he later attributed in his book to worrying about his wig falling off during the match. he reached his second grand slam final of the year at the us open, defeating defending champion boris becker in the semifinals. his opponent in the final was pete sampras; a year earlier, agassi had crushed sampras, after which time he told his coach that he felt bad for sampras because he was never going to make it as a pro. agassi lost the us open final to sampras in three sets. the rivalry between these two american players became the biggest one in tennis over the rest of the decade. agassi ended 1990 on high note as he helped the united states win its first davis cup in 8 years and won his only tennis masters cup, beating reigning wimbledon champion stefan edberg in the final.

in 1991, agassi reached his second consecutive french open final, where he faced fellow bollettieri academy alumnus jim courier. courier emerged the victor in a five-set final. agassi decided to play at wimbledon in 1991, leading to weeks of speculation in the media about the clothes he would wear. he eventually emerged for the first round in a completely white outfit. he reached the quarterfinals on that occasion, losing in five sets to david wheaton.

agassi's grand slam tournament breakthrough came at wimbledon, not at the french open or the us open, where he had previously enjoyed success. in 1992, he defeated goran ivaniå¡eviä in a five-set final. along the way, agassi overcame two former wimbledon champions: boris becker and john mcenroe. no other baseliner would triumph at wimbledon until lleyton hewitt ten years later. agassi was named the bbc overseas sports personality of the year in 1992. agassi once again played on the united states' davis cup winning team in 1992. it was their second davis cup title in three years.

in 1993, agassi won the only doubles title of his career, at the cincinnati masters, partnered with petr korda. he missed much of the early part of that year due to injuries. although he made the quarterfinals in his wimbledon title defense, he lost to eventual champion and no. 1 pete sampras in five sets. agassi lost in the first round at the us open to thomas enqvist and required wrist surgery late in the year.

with new coach brad gilbert on board, agassi began to employ more of a tactical, consistent approach, which fueled his resurgence. he started slowly in 1994, losing in the first week at the french open and wimbledon. nevertheless, he emerged during the hard-court season, winning the canadian open. his comeback culminated at the 1994 us open with a five-set fourth-round victory against michael chang. he then became the first man to capture the us open as an unseeded player, beating michael stich in the final. along the way, he beat 5 seeded players.

in 1995, agassi shaved his balding head, breaking with his old ""image is everything"" style. he competed in the 1995 australian open (his first appearance at the event) and won, beating sampras in a four-set final. agassi and sampras met in five tournament finals in 1995, all on hardcourt, with agassi winning three. agassi won three masters series events in 1995 (cincinnati, key biscayne, and the canadian open) and seven titles total. he compiled a career-best 26-match winning streak during the summer hard-court circuit, with the last victory being in an intense late night four-set semifinal of the us open against boris becker. the streak ended the next day when agassi lost the final to sampras.

agassi reached the world no. 1 ranking for the first time in april 1995. he held that ranking until november, for a total of 30 weeks. agassi skipped most of the fall indoor season which allowed sampras to surpass him and finish ranked no. 1 at the year-end ranking. in terms of win/loss record, 1995 was agassi's best year. he won 73 and lost 9 matches, and was also once again a key player on the united states' davis cup winning teamâthe third and final davis cup title of his career.

1996 was a less successful year for agassi, as he failed to reach any grand slam final. he suffered two early-round losses to chris woodruff and doug flach at the french open and wimbledon, respectively, and lost to chang in straight sets in the australian and us open semifinals. at the time, agassi blamed the australian open loss on the windy conditions, but later said in his biography that he had lost the match on purpose, as he did not want to play boris becker, whom he would have faced in that final. the high point for agassi was winning the men's singles gold medal at the olympic games in atlanta, beating sergi bruguera of spain in the final. agassi also successfully defended his singles titles in cincinnati and key biscayne.

1997 was the low point of agassi's career. his wrist injury resurfaced, and he played only 24 matches during the year. he later confessed that he started using crystal methamphetamine at that time, allegedly on the urging of a friend. he failed an atp drug test, but wrote a letter claiming the same friend had spiked a drink. the atp dropped the failed drug test as a warning. in his autobiography, agassi admitted that the letter was a lie. he quit the drug soon after. at this time agassi was also in a failing marriage with actress brooke shields and had lost interest in the game. he won no top-level titles, and his ranking sank to no. 141 on november 10, 1997, prompting many to believe that his run as one of the sport's premier competitors was over and he would never again win any significant championships.

in 1998, agassi began a rigorous conditioning program and worked his way back up the rankings by playing in challenger series tournaments, a circuit for pro players ranked outside the world's top 50. after returning to top physical and mental shape, agassi recorded the most successful period of his tennis career and also played classic matches in that period against pete sampras and patrick rafter.

in 1998, agassi won five titles and leapt from no. 110 to no. 6, the highest jump into the top 10 made by any player during a calendar year. at wimbledon, he had an early loss in the second round to tommy haas. he won five titles in ten finals and was runner-up at the masters series tournament in key biscayne, losing to marcelo rã­os, who became no. 1 as a result. at the year end he was awarded the atp most improved player of the year for the second time in his career (the first being 10 years earlier in 1988).

agassi entered the history books in 1999 when he came back from two sets to love down to beat andrei medvedev in a five-set french open final, becoming, at the time, only the fifth male player (joining rod laver, fred perry, roy emerson and don budgeâthese have since been joined by roger federer, rafael nadal, and novak djokovic) to win all four grand slam singles titles during his career. only laver, agassi, federer, nadal and djokovic have achieved this feat during the open era. this win also made him the first (of only four, the next being federer, nadal and djokovic respectively) male player in history to have won all four grand slam titles on three different surfaces (clay, grass and hard courts). agassi also became the only male player to win the career super slam, consisting of all four grand slam tournaments plus an olympic gold medal in singles and a year-end championship.

agassi followed his 1999 french open victory by reaching the wimbledon final, where he lost to sampras in straight sets. he rebounded from his wimbledon defeat by winning the us open, beating todd martin in five sets (rallying from a two sets to one deficit) in the final. overall during the year agassi won 5 titles including two majors and the atp masters series in paris, where he beat marat safin. agassi ended 1999 as the no. 1, ending sampras's record of six consecutive year-ending top rankings (1993â98). this was the only time agassi ended the year at no. 1.

he began the next year by capturing his second australian open title, beating sampras in a five-set semifinal and yevgeny kafelnikov in a four-set final. he was the first male player to have reached four consecutive grand slam finals since rod laver achieved the grand slam in 1969. at the time, agassi was also only the fourth player since laver to be the reigning champion of three of four grand slam events, missing only the wimbledon title.. 2000 also saw agassi reach the semifinals at wimbledon, where he lost in five sets to rafter in a match considered by many to be one of the best ever at wimbledon. at the inaugural tennis masters cup in lisbon, agassi reached the final after defeating marat safin in the semifinals to end the russian's hopes to become the youngest no. 1 in the history of tennis. agassi then lost to gustavo kuerten in the final, allowing kuerten to be crowned year-end no. 1.

agassi opened 2001 by successfully defending his australian open title with a straight-sets final win over arnaud clã©ment. en route, he beat a cramping rafter in five sets in front of a sell-out crowd in what turned out to be the aussie's last australian open. at wimbledon, they met again in the semifinals, where agassi lost another close match to rafter, 8â6 in the fifth set. in the quarterfinals at the us open, agassi lost a 3-hour, 33â minute epic match with sampras, 7â6, 6â7, 6â7, 6â7, with no breaks of serve during the 52-game match. despite the setback, agassi finished 2001 ranked no. 3, becoming the only male tennis player to finish a year ranked in the top 3 in three different decades (1980s, 1990s, 2000s). he was also the oldest player at the time (age 31) to finish in the top three since 32-year-old connors finished at no. 2 in 1984.

2002 opened with disappointment for agassi, as injury forced him to skip the australian open, where he was a two-time defending champion. agassi recovered from the injury and later that year defended his key biscayne title beating then rising roger federer in a four-set final. the last duel between agassi and sampras came in the final of the us open, which sampras won in four sets and left sampras with a 20â14 edge in their 34 career meetings. the match was the last of sampras's career. agassi's us open finish, along with his masters series victories in key biscayne, rome and madrid, helped him finish 2002 as the oldest year-end no. 2 at 32 years and 8 months.

in 2003, agassi won the eighth (and final) grand slam title of his career at the australian open, where he beat rainer schã¼ttler in straight sets in the final. in march, he won his sixth career and third consecutive key biscayne title, in the process surpassing his wife, steffi graf, who was a five-time winner of the event. the final was his 18th straight win in that tournament, which broke the previous record of 17 set by sampras from 1993â95. (agassi's winning streak continued to 20 after winning his first two matches at the 2004 edition of that tournament before bowing to agustã­n calleri.) with the victory, agassi became the youngest (19 years old) and oldest (32) winner of the key biscayne tournament (before djokovic and federer overtook him in 2007 and 2017 respectively).

on april 28, 2003, he recaptured the no. 1 ranking after winning the u.s. men's clay court championship and regained it after a quarterfinal victory over xavier malisse at the queen's club championships to become the oldest top-ranked male player since the atp rankings began at 33 years and 13 days. the record was later surpassed by roger federer in 2018. he had held the no. 1 ranking for two weeks, when lleyton hewitt took it back on may 12, 2003. agassi then recaptured the no. 1 ranking once again on june 16, 2003, which he held for 12 weeks until september 7, 2003. there he managed to reach the us open semifinals, where he lost to juan carlos ferrero, surrendering his no. 1 ranking to him. during his career, agassi held the ranking for a total of 101 weeks. agassi's ranking slipped when injuries forced him to withdraw from a number of events. at the year-end tennis masters cup, agassi lost in the final to federer and finished the year ranked no. 4. at age 33, he had been one of the oldest players to rank in the top 5 since connors, at age 35, was no. 4 in 1987.

in 2004, agassi began the year with a five-set loss in the semifinals of the australian open to marat safin; the loss ended agassi's 26-match winning streak at the event. he won the masters series event in cincinnati to bring his career total to 59 top-level singles titles and a record 17 atp masters series titles, having already won seven of the nine atp masters tournamentâall except the tournaments in monte carlo and hamburg. at 34, he became the second-oldest singles champion in cincinnati tournament history (the tournament began in 1899), tied with roger federer and surpassed only by ken rosewall, who won the title in 1970 at age 35. he finished the year ranked no. 8, one of the oldest players to finish in the top 10 since the 36-year-old connors was no. 7 in 1988. at the time, agassi also became the sixth male player during the open era to reach 800 career wins with his first-round victory over alex bogomolov in countrywide classic in los angeles.

agassi's 2005 began with a quarterfinal loss to federer at the australian open. agassi had several other deep runs at tournaments, but had to withdraw from several events due to injury. he lost to jarkko nieminen in the first round of the french open. he won his fourth title in los angeles and reached the final of the rogers cup, before falling to no. 2 rafael nadal.

agassi's 2005 was defined by an improbable run to the us open final. after beating räzvan sabäu and ivo karloviä in straight sets and tomã¡å¡ berdych in four sets, agassi won three consecutive five-set matches to advance to the final. the most notable of these matches was his quarterfinal victory over james blake, where he rallied from two sets down to win in the fifth set tie-breaker. his other five-set victories were on xavier malisse in the fourth round and robby ginepri in the semifinals. in the final, agassi faced federer, who was seeking his second consecutive us open title and his sixth grand slam title in two years. federer defeated agassi in four sets. agassi finished 2005 ranked no. 7, his 16th time in the year-end top-10 rankings, which tied connors for the most times ranked in the top 10 at year's end.

agassi had a poor start to 2006, as he was still recovering from an ankle injury and also suffering from back and leg pain and lack of match play. agassi withdrew from the australian open because of the ankle injury, and his back injury and other pains forced him to withdraw from several other events, eventually skipping the entire clay-court season including the french open. this caused his ranking to drop out of the top 10 for the last time. agassi returned for the grass-court season, playing a tune-up, and then wimbledon. he was defeated in the third round by world no. 2 (and eventual runner-up) rafael nadal. against conventions, agassi, the losing player, was interviewed on court after the match. at wimbledon, agassi announced his plans to retire following the us open. agassi played only two events during the summer hard-court season with his best result being a quarterfinal loss at the countrywide classic in los angeles to fernando gonzã¡lez of chile, which resulted in him being unseeded at the us open.

agassi had a short, but dramatic, run in his final us open. because of extreme back pain, agassi was forced to receive anti-inflammatory injections after every match. after a tough four-set win against andrei pavel, agassi faced eighth-seeded marcos baghdatis in the second round who had earlier advanced to the 2006 australian open final and wimbledon semifinals. agassi won in five tough sets as the younger baghdatis succumbed to muscle cramping in the final set. in his last match, agassi fell to 112th-ranked big-serving benjamin becker of germany in four sets. agassi received a four-minute standing ovation from the crowd after the match and delivered a retirement speech.

the rivalry has been called the greatest of the generation of players competing in the 90's, as sampras and agassi were the most successful players of that decade. they also had very contrasting playing styles, with sampras being considered the greatest server and agassi the greatest serve returner at the time. agassi and sampras met 34 times on the tour level with agassi trailing 14â20.

the 1990 us open was their first meeting in a grand slam tournament final. agassi was favored as he was ranked no. 4 at the time, compared to the no. 12 ranking of sampras and because agassi had defeated sampras in their only previously completed match. agassi, however, lost the final to sampras in straight sets. their next meeting in a grand slam was at the 1992 french open, where they met in the quarterfinals. although sampras was ranked higher, agassi came out winning in straight sets. they met again on a grand slam level at the quarterfinals of wimbledon in 1993, where agassi was the defending champion and sampras was the newly minted world no. 1. agassi dug himself out from a two-sets-to-love hole, levelling the match at 2 sets apiece; however, sampras prevailed in five sets, and went on to win his first wimbledon championship.

with both sampras and agassi participating, the u.s. won the davis cup in 1995. the year should be considered the peak of the rivalry as together they won 3 out of 4 major titles, meeting each other twice in the finals, and were occupying the top two spots in the rankings for the whole year. they met 5 times during the year, all in the title matches, including the australian open, the newsweek champions cup (now indian wells), the lipton international players championships (now miami open), the canadian open, and the us open. agassi won three of the finals, including the australian open; however, sampras took the us open title, ending agassi's 26-match winning streak. after agassi had taken most of the fall season off, sampras took over the no. 1 ranking for the end of the season.

in the following 3 years, while sampras continued winning grand slam titles every season, agassi slumped in the rankings and struggled in major competitions. the next time sampras and agassi met in a grand slam final was at wimbledon in 1999, where sampras won in straight sets. for both, it was considered a career rejuvenation, as sampras had suffered a string of disappointments in the previous year while agassi was regaining his status as a top-ranked player after winning the french open. sampras forfeited the no. 1 ranking to agassi when injury forced him to withdraw from that year's us open, which agassi went on to win. they faced each other twice in the season-ending atp tour world championships, with sampras losing the round-robin match, but winning the final.

in the 2000s, they met three more times on the grand slam level offering three memorable contests. in 2000, the top-ranked agassi defeated no. 3 sampras in the semifinals of the australian open in five sets, which was an important win for agassi who had lost 4 of the previous 5 matches against sampras. in arguably their most memorable match ever, sampras defeated agassi in the 2001 us open quarterfinals in four sets. there were no breaks of serve during the entire match. reruns of the match are frequently featured on television, especially during us open rain delays, and the match is considered one of the best in history because of the level of play presented by both players.

their last meeting was the final of the 2002 us open, which was their third meeting in a us open final, but the first since 1995. the match was also notable because they had defeated several up-and-coming players en route to the final. sampras had defeated no. 3 tommy haas in the fourth round and future no. 1 andy roddick in the quarterfinals, while agassi had defeated no. 1 and defending champion lleyton hewitt in the semifinals. sampras defeated agassi in four sets. this was the final atp tour singles match of sampras's career.

michael chang was the opponent agassi faced the most frequently from all the players other than sampras. they met 22 times on the tour level with agassi leading 15-7. chang, unlike most of agassi's big rivals, had a playing style similar to his. both players preferred to stay at the baseline with chang being more defensive-minded. the outcome was that most of their meetings were built on long and entertaining rallies. the rivalry began late in the 1980s with both players being considered the prodigies of the next great generation of american tennis players, despite both having a foreign descent.

agassi won the first four matches including a straight-set victory in round 16 of the 1988 us open and defeating chang, the defending champion, in the 1990 french open in a four-set quarterfinal. arguably their best match took place in round 16 of the 1994 us open. while both players presented high-quality shot-making, the momentum changed from set to set with agassi eventually prevailing in a five-set victory. it turned out to be the toughest contest on his way to his first us open title. their next two grand slam meetings came in 1996, with chang recording easy straight-set victories in the semifinals of both the australian open and the us open. years after, agassi shockingly admitted in his book that he had lost the first of the matches on purpose as he did not want to face boris becker, who was awaiting the winner in the final. agassi won the last four of their matches, with the last being in 2003 at the miami open with chang being clearly past his prime.

boris becker and agassi played 14 times with agassi leading 10â4. becker won their first three matches in 1988 and 1989 before agassi reversed the rivalry in 1990, and won 10 of their last 11 matches. they first played at indian wells in 1988, with becker prevailing. their most notable match was the 1989 davis cup semifinal match, which becker won in five sets after losing the first two in tiebreaks. agassi, considered a baseliner with a playing style not suiting grass, shocked becker, a three-time champion, in a five-set quarterfinal at wimbledon in 1992 on his way to his first grand slam title. the intensity of the rivalry peaked in 1995. becker won that year's wimbledon semifinal after being down a set and two breaks, to eventually win in four sets. in a highly anticipated rematch in the us open semifinal, this time it was agassi who came out victorious in four tight sets. their final match was played at hong kong in 1999, which agassi won in three sets.

agassi and pat rafter played fifteen times with agassi leading 10â5. the rivalry has been considered special and delivered memorable encounters, because of the players' contrasting styles of play, with rafter using traditional serve-&-volley methods against agassi's variety of return of serves and passing shots as his main weapons. agassi led 8â2 on hard courts, but rafter surprisingly won their sole match on clay at the 1999 rome masters. they played four matches at wimbledon with both winning two matches each. agassi won the first two in 1993 and 1999, while rafter took their 2000 and 2001 encounters, both of the gruelling 5-setters often being presented on the lists of best matches ever played. agassi also won both their meetings at the australian open, in 1995 and 2001, on his way to the title on both occasions. rafter, however, took their only us open encounter in 1997 and went on to win the title.

agassi and roger federer played 11 times, and federer led their head-to-head series 8â3. with the retirement of sampras, the rivalry against the 11-years-younger federer, who was another great server like sampras, became agassi's main rivalry for the final years of his career. agassi won their first three matches, but then went on to lose eight consecutive ones. they first met in just the third tournament of federer's career at the 1998 swiss indoors in federer's hometown, with agassi prevailing over the 17-year-old. agassi also defeated federer at the 2001 us open and the finals of the miami open in 2002. federer began to turn the tide at the masters cup in 2003, when he defeated agassi in both the round robin and the final. they played a memorable quarterfinal match at the 2004 us open that spanned over two windy days, with federer eventually prevailing in five sets. at the 2005 dubai championships, federer and agassi attracted worldwide headlines with a publicity stunt that saw the two tennis legends play on a helipad almost 220 meters above sea level at the hotel burj al-arab. their final duel took place in the final of the 2005 us open. in the historic clash of generations, federer was victorious in four sets in front of a pro-agassi crowd. the match was the last appearance by agassi in any tournament final.

agassi and ivan lendl played 8 times, and lendl led their head-to-head series 6â2.

agassi and stefan edberg played 9 times, and agassi led their head-to-head series 6â3.

agassi earned more than $30â million in prize-money during his career, sixth only to djokovic, federer, nadal, sampras and murray to date (may 2018). he also earned more than $25â million a year through endorsements during his career, which was ranked fourth in all sports at the time.

since retiring after the 2006 us open, agassi has participated in a series of charity tournaments and continues his work with his own charity. on september 5, 2007, he was a surprise guest commentator for the andy roddick/roger federer us open quarterfinal. he played an exhibition match at wimbledon, teaming with his wife, steffi graf, to play with tim henman and kim clijsters. he played world team tennis for the philadelphia freedoms in the summer of 2009. at the 2009 french open, agassi was on hand to present roger federer, who completed his career grand slam by winning the tournament and joined agassi as one of six men to complete the career grand slam, with the trophy.

also in 2009, agassi played at the outback champions series event for the first time. he played the cancer treatment centers of america tennis championships at surprise, arizona, where he reached the final before bowing to eventual champion todd martin. he also announced that he will not be playing the tour on a full-time basis, and played the tournament as a favor to long-time friend jim courier. agassi returned to the tour renamed for the powershares series in 2011 and participated in a total of seven events while winning two. agassi beat courier in the final of the staples champions cup in boston and later defeated sampras at the ctca championships at his hometown las vegas.

in 2012, agassi took part in five tournaments, winning three of those. in november, at first he won bilt champions showdown in san jose, beating john mcenroe in the final. the following day, he defended his title of the ctca championships, while defeating courier in the decisive match. in the series season finale, he beat michael chang for the acura champions cup. the series and agassi came back to action in 2014. agassi won both tournaments he participated in. at the camden wealth advisors cup's final in houston, agassi beat james blake for a rematch of their 2005 us open quarterfinal. he defeated blake again in portland to win the title of the cancer treatment centers of america championships. in 2015, agassi took part in just one event of the powershares series, losing to mark philippoussis in the final of the champions shootout. the following year he took part in two events, at first losing to blake in chicago, and the next day defeating mardy fish, but losing to roddick in charleston.

in 2009, in macau agassi and sampras met for the first time on court since the 2002 us open final. sampras won the exhibition in three sets. the rivalry between the former champions headlined sports media again in march 2010 after the two participated in the ""hit for haiti"" charity event organized to raise money for the victims of the earthquake. partnered with roger federer and rafael nadal, the old rivals began making jokes at each other's expense, which ended up with sampras intentionally striking a serve at agassi's body. after the event, agassi admitted that he had crossed the line with his jokes and publicly apologized to sampras. agassi and sampras met again one year later for an exhibition match at madison square garden in new york in front of 19 000 spectators as sampras defeated agassi in two sets. on march 3, 2014, agassi and sampras squared off for an exhibition in london for the annual world tennis day. this time, it was agassi who came out on top in two straight sets.

he returned to the tour in may 2017 in the position of coach to novak djokovic for the french open. agassi announced the end of the partnership on march 31, 2018, stating that there were too many disagreements in the relationship.

early in his career, agassi would look to end points quickly by playing first-strike tennis, typically by inducing a weak return with a deep, hard shot, and then playing a winner at an extreme angle. on the rare occasion that he charged the net, agassi liked to take the ball in the air and hit a swinging volley for a winner. his favored groundstroke was his flat, accurate two-handed backhand, hit well cross-court but especially down the line. his forehand was nearly as strong, especially his inside-out to the ad court.

agassi's strength was in dictating play from the baseline, and he was able to consistently take the ball on the rise. while he was growing up, his father and nick bollettieri trained him in this way. when in control of a point, agassi would often pass up an opportunity to attempt a winner and hit a conservative shot to minimize his errors, and to make his opponent run more. this change to more methodical, less aggressive baseline play was largely initiated by his longtime coach, brad gilbert, in their first year together in 1994. gilbert encouraged agassi to wear out opponents with his deep, flat groundstrokes and to use his fitness to win attrition wars, and noted agassi's two-handed backhand down the line as his very best shot. a signature play later in his career was a change up drop shot to the deuce court after deep penetrating groundstrokes. this would often be followed by a passing shot or lob if the opponent was fast enough to retrieve it.

agassi was raised on hardcourts, but found much of his early major-tournament success on the red clay of roland garros, reaching two consecutive finals there early in his career. despite grass being his worst surface, his first major win was at the slick grass of wimbledon in 1992, a tournament that he professed to hating at the time. his strongest surface over the course of his career, was indeed hardcourt, where he won six of his eight majors.

agassi established a limited liability company named andre agassi ventures (formerly named agassi enterprises). agassi, along with five athlete partners (including wayne gretzky, joe montana, shaquille o'neal, ken griffey, jr., and monica seles) opened a chain of sports-themed restaurant named official all star cafã© in april 1996. the restaurant closed down in 2001. in 1999, he paid $1 million for a 10 percent stake in nevada first bank and made a $10 million profit when it was sold to western alliance bancorp in 2006. in 2002, he joined the tennis channel to promote the channel to consumers and cable and satellite industry, and made an equity investment in the network. after meeting chef michael mina at one of his restaurants in san francisco, agassi partnered with him in 2002 to start mina group inc. and opened 18 concept restaurants in san francisco, san jose, dana point, atlantic city and las vegas. agassi was an equity investor of a group that acquired golden nugget las vegas and golden nugget laughlin from mgm mirage for $215 million in 2004. one year later, the group sold the hotel-casino to landry's, inc. for $163 million in cash and $182 million in assumed debt. in 2007, he sat on the board of meadows bank, an independent bank in nevada. he has invested in start-up companies backed by allen & company.

agassi and graf formed a company called agassi graf holdings. they invested in pure, a nightclub at caesars palace, which opened in 2004, and sold it to angel management group in 2010. in august 2006, agassi and graf developed a joint venture with high-end furniture maker kreiss enterprises. they launched a furniture line called agassi graf collection. in september, agassi and graf, through their company agassi graf development llc, along with bayview financial lp, finalized an agreement to develop a condominium hotel, fairmont tamarack, at tamarack resort in donnelly, idaho. due to difficult market conditions and delays, they withdrew from the project in 2009. the group still owns three small chunks of land. in september, they collaborated with steve case's exclusive resorts to co-develop luxury resorts and design agassi-graf tennis and fitness centers.

they also invested in online ticket reseller viagogo in 2009 and both serve as board members and advisors of the company.

in october 2012, village roadshow and investors including agassi and graf announced plans to build a new water park called wet'n'wild las vegas in las vegas. village roadshow has a 51% stake in the park while agassi, graf, and other private investors hold the remaining 49%. the park opened in may 2013.

img managed agassi from the time he turned pro in 1986 through january 2000 before switching to sfx sports group. his business manager, lawyer and agent was childhood friend perry rogers, but they have been estranged since 2008. in 2009, he and graf signed with caa.

agassi used prince graphite rackets early in his career. he signed a $7 million endorsement contract with belgian tennis racquet makers donnay. he later switched to head ti radical racket and head's liquidmetal radical racket, having signed a multimillion-dollar endorsement deal with head in 1993. he renewed his contract in 1999, and in november 2003 he signed a lifetime agreement with head. he also endorses penn tennis balls. on july 25, 2005, agassi left nike after 17 years and signed an endorsement deal with adidas. a major reason for agassi leaving nike was because nike refused to donate to agassi's charities, and adidas was more than happy to do so. on may 13, 2013, agassi rejoined nike.

agassi was sponsored by dupont, ebel, mountain dew in 1993, mazda in 1997, kia motors in 2002, american express and deutsche bank in 2003. in 1990, he appeared in a television commercial for canon inc., promoting the canon eos rebel camera. between 1999 and 2000, he signed a multimillion-dollar, multiyear endorsement deal with schick and became the worldwide spokesman for the company. agassi signed a multiyear contract with twinlab and promoted the company's nutritional supplements. in mid-2003, he was named the spokesman of aramis life, a fragrance by aramis, and signed a five-year deal with the company. in march 2004, he signed a ten-year agreement worth $1.5 million a year with 24 hour fitness, which will open five andre agassi fitness centers by year-end. prior to the 2012 australian open, agassi and australian winemaker jacobs creek announced a three-year partnership and created the open film series to ""[share] personal stories about the life defining moments that shaped his character on and off the court."" in 2007, watchmaker longines named agassi as their brand ambassador.

agassi and his mother appeared in a got milk? advertisement in 2002.

agassi has appeared in many advertisements and television commercials with graf. they both endorsed deutsche telekom in 2002, genworth financial and canon inc. in 2004, lvmh in 2007, and nintendo wii and wii fit u and longines in 2013.

in the early 1990s agassi dated american singer and entertainer barbra streisand. he wrote about the relationship in his 2009 autobiography, ""we agree that we're good for each other, and so what if she's twenty-eight years older? we're sympatico, and the public outcry only adds spice to our connection. it makes our friendship feel forbidden, taboo â another piece of my overall rebellion. dating barbra streisand is like wearing hot lava."" 

he was married to brooke shields from 1997 to 1999.

he married steffi graf on october 22, 2001 at their las vegas home; the only witnesses were their mothers. they have two children: son jaden gil (born 2001) and daughter jaz elle (born 2003). agassi has said that he and graf are not pushing their children toward becoming tennis players. the graf-agassi family resides in summerlin, a community in the las vegas valley. graf's mother and brother, michael, with his four children also live there.

long-time trainer gil reyes has been called one of agassi's closest friends; some have described him as being a ""father figure"" to agassi. in 2012, agassi and reyes introduced their own line of fitness equipment, bilt by agassi and reyes. in december 2008, agassi's childhood friend and former business manager, perry rogers, sued graf for $50,000 in management fees he claimed that she owed him.

agassi's autobiography, ""open: an autobiography,"" (written with assistance from j. r. moehringer), was published in november 2009. in it, agassi opens up about his childhood or having to grow up with a very unconventional armenian father who came to the united states from iran where he was a professional boxer. overly demanding and emotionally abusive to the whole family, his father groomed young agassi for tennis greatness by building a tennis court in their backyard and sending agassi to tennis boarding school under the supervision of nick bollettieri, who later coached and managed part of agassi's professional career.

agassi's struggle to cope throughout his youth whilst he was forced to be away from his family and friends at such a young age, to become a top-rated player and celebrity, to build a team that he can trust, to fight on the court physically and emotionally for every point, to succeed in so many games but also experience devastating defeats across unrelenting rivals â this is all meticulously detailed in his autobiography.

there is also mention in the book of using and testing positive for methamphetamine in 1997. in response to this revelation, roger federer declared himself shocked and disappointed, while marat safin argued that agassi should return his prize money and be stripped of his titles. in an interview with cbs, agassi justified himself and asked for understanding, saying that ""it was a period in my life where i needed help.""

agassi said that he had always hated tennis during his career because of the constant pressure it exerted on him. he also said he wore a hairpiece earlier in his career and thought pete sampras was ""robotic"".

the book reached no. 1 on the ""new york times"" best seller list and received favorable reviews. it won the autobiography category of the 2010 british sports book awards. in 2018 the book was listed on ""esquire"" as one of ""the 30 best sports books ever written"", and was also recommended by self-help author tim ferriss who described it as ""very candid, very amusing, and very instructional"".

in 2017, agassi appeared in the documentary film ""love means zero"", which highlighted the troubled relationship between his coach nick bollettieri and him.

agassi has donated more than $100,000 to democratic candidates, and $2000 to republicans. on september 1, 2010, when he appeared on daily wnyc public radio program ""the brian lehrer show,"" he stated that he is registered as independent.

agassi founded the andre agassi charitable association in 1994, which assists las vegas' young people. he was awarded the atp arthur ashe humanitarian award in 1995 for his efforts to help disadvantaged youth. he has been cited as the most charitable and socially involved player in professional tennis. it has also been claimed that he may be the most charitable athlete of his generation.

agassi's charities help in assisting children reach their athletic potential. his boys & girls club sees 2,000 children throughout the year and boasts a world-class junior tennis team. it also has a basketball program (the agassi stars) and a rigorous system that encourages a mix of academics and athletics.

in 2001, agassi opened the andre agassi college preparatory academy in las vegas, a tuition-free charter school for at-risk children in the area. he personally donated $35 million to the school. in 2009, the graduating class had a 100 percent graduation rate and expected a 100 percent college acceptance rate. among other child-related programs that agassi supports through his andre agassi charitable foundation is clark county's only residential facility for abused and neglected children, child haven. in 1997, agassi donated funding to child haven for a six-room classroom building now named the agassi center for education. his foundation also provided $720,000 to assist in the building of the andre agassi cottage for medically fragile children. this 20-bed facility opened in december 2001, and accommodates developmentally delayed or handicapped children and children quarantined for infectious diseases.

in 2007, along with several other athletes, agassi founded the charity athletes for hope, which helps professional athletes get involved in charitable causes and aims to inspire all people to volunteer and support their communities. he created the canyon-agassi charter school facilities fund, now known as the turner-agassi charter school facilities fund. the fund is an investment initiative for social change, focusing on the ""nationwide effort to move charters from stopgap buildings into permanent campuses.""

in september 2013, the andre agassi foundation for education formed a partnership with v20 foods to launch box budd!es, a line of kids' healthy snacks. all proceeds go to the foundation.

in february 2014, agassi remodeled the vacant university of phoenix building as a new school called the doral academy west through the canyon-agassi charter school facilities fund. doral academy opened in august 2014. the fund purchased a 4.6-acre plot in henderson, nevada to house the somerset academy of las vegas, which will relocate from its campus inside a church.

by winning the 1999 french open, agassi completed a men's singles career grand slam. he is the 5th of 8 male players in history (after budge, perry, laver and emerson, and before federer, nadal and djokovic) to achieve this.

considered by numerous sources to be one of the greatest tennis players of all time, agassi has also been called one of the greatest service returner ever to play the game, and was described by the bbc upon his retirement as ""perhaps the biggest worldwide star in the sport's history"". as a result, he is credited for helping to revive the popularity of tennis during the 1990s.
"
larry page,"
lawrence edward page (born march 26, 1973) is an american computer scientist and internet entrepreneur. he is best known for being one of the co-founders of google along with sergey brin.

page is the chief executive officer of alphabet inc. (google's parent company). after stepping aside as google ceo in august 2001, in favor of eric schmidt, he re-assumed the role in april 2011. he announced his intention to step aside a second time in july 2015, to become ceo of alphabet, under which google's assets would be reorganized. under page, alphabet is seeking to deliver major advancements in a variety of industries.

as of october 2019, page is the 9th-richest person in the world, with a net worth of $55.8â billion. forbes placed him 10th in the list ""billionaires 2019"".

page is the co-inventor of pagerank, a well-known search ranking algorithm for google, which he wrote with brin. page received the marconi prize in 2004 with brin.

page was born on march 26, 1973, in lansing, michigan, michigan. his father is jewish; his maternal grandfather later made aliyah to israel. however he does not declare to follow any formal religion. his father, carl victor page, sr., earned a phd in computer science from the university of michigan, when the field was being established, and bbc reporter will smale has described him as a ""pioneer in computer science and artificial intelligence"". he was a computer science professor at michigan state university and page's mother, gloria, was an instructor in computer programming at lyman briggs college of michigan state university.

during an interview, page recalled his childhood, noting that his house ""was usually a mess, with computers, science, and technology magazines and ""popular science"" magazines all over the place"", an environment in which he immersed himself. page was an avid reader during his youth, writing in his 2013 google founders letter: ""i remember spending a huge amount of time pouring [sic] over books and magazines"". according to writer nicholas carlson, the combined influence of page's home atmosphere and his attentive parents ""fostered creativity and invention"". page also played flute and studied music composition while growing up. he attended the renowned music summer camp â interlochen arts camp at interlochen, michigan. page has mentioned that his musical education inspired his impatience and obsession with speed in computing. ""in some sense, i feel like music training led to the high-speed legacy of google for me"". in an interview page said that ""in music, you're very cognizant of time. time is like the primary thing"" and that ""if you think about it from a music point of view, if you're a percussionist, you hit something, it's got to happen in milliseconds, fractions of a second"".

page was first attracted to computers when he was six years old, as he was able to ""play with the stuff lying around""âfirst-generation personal computersâthat had been left by his mother and father. he became the ""first kid in his elementary school to turn in an assignment from a word processor"". his older brother also taught him to take things apart and before long he was taking ""everything in his house apart to see how it worked"". he said that ""from a very early age, i also realized i wanted to invent things. so i became really interested in technology and business. probably from when i was 12, i knew i was going to start a company eventually.""

page attended the okemos montessori school (now called montessori radmoor) in okemos, michigan, from 1975 to 1979, and graduated from east lansing high school in 1991. he attended interlochen center for the arts as a saxophonist for two summers while in high school. page holds a bachelor of science in computer engineering from the university of michigan, with honors and a master of science in computer science from stanford university. while at the university of michigan, page created an inkjet printer made of lego bricks (literally a line plotter), after he thought it possible to print large posters cheaply with the use of inkjet cartridgesâpage reverse-engineered the ink cartridge, and built all of the electronics and mechanics to drive it. page served as the president of the beta epsilon chapter of the eta kappa nu fraternity, and was a member of the 1993 ""maize & blue"" university of michigan solar car team. as an undergraduate at the university of michigan, he proposed that the school replace its bus system with a prt system which is essentially a driverless monorail with separate cars for every passenger. he also developed a business plan for a company that would use software to build a music synthesizer during this time.

after enrolling in a computer science phd program at stanford university, page was in search of a dissertation theme and considered exploring the mathematical properties of the world wide web, understanding its link structure as a huge graph. his supervisor, terry winograd, encouraged him to pursue the idea, and page recalled in 2008 that it was the best advice he had ever received. he also considered doing research on telepresence and self-driving cars during this time.<ref name=""doi10.1016/s0169-75529800110-x""></ref>

page focused on the problem of finding out which web pages linked to a given page, considering the number and nature of such backlinks as valuable information for that page. the role of citations in academic publishing would also become pertinent for the research. sergey brin, a fellow stanford phd student, would soon join page's research project, nicknamed ""backrub."" together, the pair authored a research paper titled ""the anatomy of a large-scale hypertextual web search engine"", which became one of the most downloaded scientific documents in the history of the internet at the time.

john battelle, co-founder of ""wired"" magazine, wrote that page had reasoned that the:

... entire web was loosely based on the premise of citationâafter all, what is a link but a citation? if he could devise a method to count and qualify each backlink on the web, as page puts it ""the web would become a more valuable place.""

battelle further described how page and brin began working together on the project:

to convert the backlink data gathered by backrub's web crawler into a measure of importance for a given web page, brin and page developed the pagerank algorithm, and realized that it could be used to build a search engine far superior to existing ones. the algorithm relied on a new technology that analyzed the relevance of the backlinks that connected one web page to another.

combining their ideas, the pair began utilizing page's dormitory room as a machine laboratory, and extracted spare parts from inexpensive computers to create a device that they used to connect the not nascent search engine with stanford's broadband campus network. after filling page's room with equipment, they then converted brin's dorm room into an office and programming center, where they tested their new search engine designs on the web. the rapid growth of their project caused stanford's computing infrastructure to experience problems.
page and brin used the former's basic html programming skills to set up a simple search page for users, as they did not have a web page developer to create anything visually elaborate. they also began using any computer part they could find to assemble the necessary computing power to handle searches by multiple users. as their search engine grew in popularity among stanford users, it required additional servers to process the queries. in august 1996, the initial version of google, still on the stanford university website, was made available to internet users.

by early 1997, the backrub page described the state as follows:
backrub already exhibited the rudimentary functions and characteristics of a search engine: a query input was entered and it provided a list of backlinks ranked by importance. page recalled: ""we realized that we had a querying tool. it gave you a good overall ranking of pages and ordering of follow-up pages."" page said that in mid-1998 they finally realized the further potential of their project: ""pretty soon, we had 10,000 searches a day. and we figured, maybe this is really real.""

some compared page and brin's vision to the impact of johannes gutenberg, the inventor of modern printing:

the comparison was also noted by the authors of ""the google story"": ""not since gutenbergâ ... has any new invention empowered individuals, and transformed access to information, as profoundly as google."" also, not long after the two ""cooked up their new engine for web searches, they began thinking about information that was at the time beyond the web,"" such as digitizing books and expanding health information.

mark malseed wrote in a 2003 feature story:

soliciting funds from faculty members, family and friends, brin and page scraped together enough to buy some servers and rent that famous garage in menlo park. ... [soon after], sun microsystems co-founder andy bechtolsheim wrote a $100,000 check to ""google, inc."" the only problem was, ""google, inc."" did not yet existâthe company hadn't yet been incorporated. for two weeks, as they handled the paperwork, the young men had nowhere to deposit the money.

in 1998, brin and page incorporated google, inc. with the initial domain name of ""googol,"" derived from a number that consists of one followed by one hundred zerosârepresenting the vast amount of data that the search engine was intended to explore. following inception, page appointed himself as ceo, while brin, named google's co-founder, served as google's president. writer nicholas carlson wrote in 2014:

while google is often thought of as the invention of two young computer whizzesâsergey and larry, larry and sergeyâthe truth is that google is a creation of larry page, helped along by sergey brin.

the pair's mission was ""to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful."" with a us$1-million loan from friends and family, the inaugural team moved into a mountain view office by the start of 2000. in 1999, page experimented with smaller servers so google could fit more into each square meter of the third-party warehouses the company rented for their servers. this eventually led to a search engine that ran much faster than google's competitors at the time.

by june 2000, google had indexed one billion internet urls (uniform resource locators), making it the most comprehensive search engine on the web at the time. the company cited nec research institute data in its june 26 press release, stating that ""there are more than 1â billion web pages online today,"" with google ""providing access to 560 million full-text indexed web pages and 500â million partially indexed urls.""

during his first tenure as ceo, page embarked on an attempt to fire all of google's project managers in 2001. page's plan involved all of google's engineers reporting to a vp of engineering, who would then report directly to himâpage explained that he didn't like non-engineers supervising engineers due to their limited technical knowledge. page even documented his management tenets for his team to use as a reference:


even though page's new model was unsustainable and led to disgruntlement among the affected employees, his issue with engineers being managed by non-engineering staff gained traction more broadly. eventually, the practice of only instating engineers into the management roles of engineering teams was established as a standard across silicon valley.

page also believed that the faster google's search engine returned answers, the more it would be used. he fretted over milliseconds and pushed his engineersâfrom those who developed algorithms to those who built data centersâto think about lag times. he also pushed for keeping google's home page famously sparse in its design because it would help the search results load faster.

before silicon valley's two most prominent investors, kleiner perkins caufield & byers and sequoia capital, agreed to invest a combined total of $50â million in google, they applied pressure on page to step down as ceo so that a more experienced leader could build a ""world-class management team."" page eventually became amenable to the idea after meeting with other technology ceos, including steve jobs and intel's andrew grove. eric schmidt, who had been hired as chairman of google in march 2001, left his full-time position as the ceo of novell to take the same role at google in august of the same year, and page moved aside to assume the president of products role.

under schmidt's leadership, google underwent a period of major growth and expansion, which included its initial public offering (ipo) on august 20, 2004. he always acted in consultation with page and brin when he embarked on initiatives such as the hiring of an executive team and the creation of a sales force management system. page remained the boss at google in the eyes of the employees, as he gave final approval on all new hires, and it was page who provided the signature for the ipo, the latter making him a billionaire at the age of 30.

page led the acquisition of android for $50â million in 2005 to fulfill his ambition to place handheld computers in the possession of consumers so that they could access google anywhere. the purchase was made without schmidt's knowledge, but the ceo was not perturbed by the relatively small acquisition. page became passionate about android, and spent large amounts of time with android ceo and cofounder andy rubin. by september 2008, t-mobile launched the g1, the first phone using android software and, by 2010, 17.2% of the handset market consisted of android sales, overtaking apple for the first time. android became the world's most popular mobile operating system shortly afterward.

following a january 2011 announcement, page officially became the chief executive of google on april 4, 2011, while schmidt stepped down to become executive chairman. by this time, google had over $180â billion market capitalization and more than 24,000 employees.

after schmidt announced the end of his tenure as ceo on january 20, 2011, he jokingly tweeted on twitter: ""adult-supervision no longer needed."" quartz organizational management reporter, max nisen, described the decade prior to page's second appointment as google's ceo as his ""lost decade."" while page continued to exert a significant influence at google during this time, overseeing product development and other operations, he became increasingly disconnected and less responsive over time.

as google's new ceo, page's two key goals were the development of greater autonomy for the executives overseeing the most important divisions, and higher levels of collaboration, communication and unity among the teams. page also formed what the media called the ""l-team,"" a group of senior vice-presidents who reported directly to him and worked in close proximity to his office for a portion of the working week. additionally, he reorganized the company's senior management, placing a ceo-like manager at the top of google's most important product divisions, including youtube, adwords, and google search.

in accordance with a more cohesive team environment, page declared a new ""zero tolerance for fighting"" policy that contrasted with his approach during the early days of google, when he would use his harsh and intense arguments with brin as an exemplar for senior management. page had changed his thinking during his time away from the ceo role, as he eventually arrived at the conclusion that his greatly ambitious goals required a harmonious team dynamic. as part of page's collaborative rejuvenation process, google's products and applications were consolidated and underwent an aesthetic overhaul.

at least 70 of google's products, features and services were eventually shut down by march 2013, while the appearance and nature of the remaining ones were unified. jon wiley, lead designer of google search at the time, codenamed page's redesign overhaul, which officially commenced on april 4, 2011, ""project kennedy,"" based on page's use of the term ""moonshots"" to describe ambitious projects in a january 2013 ""wired"" interview. an initiative named ""kanna"" previously attempted to create a uniform design aesthetic for google's range of products, but it was too difficult at that point in the company's history for one team to drive such change. matias duarte, senior director of the android user experience at the time that ""kennedy"" started, explained in 2013 that ""google passionately cares about design."" page proceeded to consult with the google creative lab design team, based in new york city, to find an answer to his question of what a ""cohesive vision"" of google might look like.

the eventual results of ""kennedy,"" which were progressively rolled out from june 2011 until january 2013, were described by the verge technology publication as focused upon ""refinement, white space, cleanliness, elasticity, usefulness, and most of all simplicity."" the final products were aligned with page's aim for a consistent suite of products that can ""move fast,"" and ""kennedy"" was called a ""design revolution"" by duarte. page's ""uxa"" (user/graphics interface) design team then emerged from the ""kennedy"" project, tasked with ""designing and developing a true ui framework that transforms google's application software into a beautiful, mature, accessible and consistent platform for its users."" unspoken of in public, the small uxa unit was designed to ensure that ""kennedy"" became an ""institution.""

when acquiring products and companies for google, page asked whether the business acquisition passed the toothbrush test as an initial qualifier, asking the question ""is it something you will use once or twice a day, and does it make your life better?"". this approach looked for usefulness above profitability, and long-term potential over near-term financial gain, which has been noted as rare in business acquiring processes.

with facebook's influence rapidly expanding during the start of page's second tenure, he finally responded to the intensive competition with google's own social network, google+, in mid-2011. after several delays, the social network was released through a very limited field test and was led by vic gundotra, google's then senior vice president of social.

in august 2011, page announced that google would spend $12.5â billion to acquire motorola mobility. the purchase was primarily motivated by google's need to secure patents to protect android from lawsuits by companies including apple inc. page wrote on google's official blog on august 15, 2011 that ""companies including microsoft and apple are banding together in anti-competitive patent attacks on android. the united states department of justice had to intervene in the results of one recent patent auction to ""protect competition and innovation in the open source software community""... our acquisition of motorola will increase competition by strengthening google's patent portfolio, which will enable us to better protect android from anti-competitive threats from microsoft, apple and other companies"".

page also ventured into hardware and google unveiled the chromebook in may 2012. the hardware product was a laptop that ran on a google operating system, chrome os.

in january 2013, page participated in a rare interview with ""wired"", in which writer steven levy discussed page's ""10x"" mentalityâgoogle employees are expected to create products and services that are at least 10 times better than those of its competitorsâin the introductory blurb. astro teller, the head of google x, explained to levy that 10x is ""just core to who he [page] is,"" while page's ""focus is on where the next 10x will come from."" in his interview with levy, page referred to the success of youtube and android as examples of ""crazy"" ideas that investors were not initially interested in, saying: ""if you're not doing some things that are crazy, then you're doing the wrong things."" page also stated that he was ""very happy"" with the status of google+, and discussed concerns over the internet in relation to the sopa bill and an international telecommunication union proposal that had been recently introduced:

... i do think the internet's under much greater attack than it has been in the past. governments are now afraid of the internet because of the middle east stuff, and so they're a little more willing to listen to what i see as a lot of commercial interests that just want to make money by restricting people's freedoms. but they've also seen a tremendous user reaction, like the backlash against sopa. i think that governments fight users' freedoms at their own peril.

at the may 2013 i/o developers conference in san francisco, page delivered a keynote address and said that ""we're at maybe 1% of what is possible. despite the faster change, we're still moving slow relative to the opportunities we have. i think a lot of that is because of the negativity ... every story i read is google vs someone else. that's boring. we should be focusing on building the things that don't exist"" and that he was ""sad the web isn't advancing as fast as it should be"" citing a perceived focus on negativity and zero sum games among some in the technology sector as a cause for that. in response to an audience question, page noted an issue that google had been experiencing with microsoft, whereby the latter made its outlook program interoperable with google, but did not allow for backward compatibilityâhe referred to microsoft's practice as ""milking off."" during the question-and-answer section of his keynote, page expressed interest in burning man, which brin had previously praisedâit was a motivating factor for the latter during schmidt's hiring process, as brin liked that schmidt had attended the week-long annual event.

in september 2013, page launched the independent calico initiative, a r&d project in the field of biotechnology. google announced that calico seeks to innovate and make improvements in the field of human health, and appointed art levinson, chairman of apple's board and former ceo of genentech, to be the new division's ceo. page's official statement read: ""illness and aging affect all our families. with some longer term, moonshot thinking around healthcare and biotechnology, i believe we can improve millions of lives.""

page participated in a march 2014 tedx conference that was held in vancouver, british columbia, canada. the presentation was scripted by page's chief pr executive rachel whetstone, and google's cmo lorraine twohill, and a demonstration of an artificially intelligent computer program was displayed on a large screen.
page responded to a question about corporations, noting that corporations largely get a ""bad rap"", which he stated was because they were probably doing the same incremental things they were doing ""50 or 20 years ago"". he went on to juxtapose that kind of incremental approach to his vision of google counteracting calcification through driving technology innovation at a high rate. page mentioned elon musk and spacex:

he [musk] wants to go to mars to back up humanity. that's a worthy goal. we have a lot of employees at google who've become pretty wealthy. you're working because you want to change the world and make it better ... i'd like for us to help out more than we are.

page also mentioned nikola tesla with regard to invention and commercialization:

invention is not enough. [nikola] tesla invented the electric power we use, but he struggled to get it out to people. [you have to] combine both things ... invention and innovation focus, plus ... a company that can really commercialize things and get them to people.

page announced a major management restructure in october 2014 so that he would no longer need to be responsible for day-to-day product-related decision making. in a memo, page said that google's core businesses would be able to progress in a typical manner, while he could focus on the next generation of ambitious projects, including google x initiatives; access and energy, including google fiber; smart-home automation through nest labs; and biotechnology innovations under calico. page maintained that he would continue as the unofficial ""chief product officer."" subsequent to the announcement, the executives in charge of google's core products reported to then google senior vice president sundar pichai, who reported directly to page.

in a november 2014 interview, page stated that he prioritized the maintenance of his ""deep knowledge"" of google's products and breadth of projects, as it had been a key motivating factor for team members. in relation to his then role as the company's ceo, page said: ""i think my job as ceoâi feel like it's always to be pushing people ahead.""

on august 10, 2015, page announced on google's official blog that google had restructured into a number of subsidiaries of a new holding company known as alphabet inc with page becoming ceo of alphabet inc and sundar pichai assuming the position of ceo of google inc. in his announcement, page described the planned holding company as follows:

as well as explaining the origin of the company's name:

page wrote that the motivation behind the reorganization is to make google ""cleaner and more accountable."" he also wrote that there was a desire to improve ""the transparency and oversight of what we're doing,"" and to allow greater control of unrelated companies previously within the google ecosystem.

page has not been on any press conferences since 2015 and has not presented at product launches or earnings calls since 2013. the ""bloomberg businessweek"" termed the reorganization into alphabet as a clever retirement plan allowing page to retain control over google, at the same time relinquishing all responsibilities over it. executives at alphabet describe page as a ""futurist"", highly detached from day-to-day business dealings and more focused on moon-shot projects. while some managers of alphabet companies speak of page as intensely involved, others say that his rare office check-ins are ""akin to a royal visit"".

page is an investor in tesla motors. he has invested in renewable energy technology, and with the help of google.org, google's philanthropic arm, promotes the adoption of plug-in hybrid electric cars and other alternative energy investments. he is also a strategic backer in the opener startup which is developing aerial vehicles for consumer travel.

page is also interested in the socio-economic effects of advanced intelligent systems and how advanced digital technologies can be used to create abundance (as described in ), provide for people's needs, shorten the workweek, and mitigate the potential detrimental effects of technological unemployment.

page also helped to set up singularity university, a transhumanist think-tank. 
google is one of the institution's corporate founders and still funds scholarships at singularity university.

in 2007, page married lucinda southworth on necker island, the caribbean island owned by richard branson. southworth is a research scientist and the sister of actress and model carrie southworth. page and southworth have two children, born in 2009 and 2011.

on february 18, 2005, page bought a spanish colonial revival architecture house in palo alto, california designed by american artistic polymath pedro joseph de lemos, a former curator of the stanford art museum and founder of the carmel art institute, after the historic building had been on the market for years with an asking price of us$7.95â million. a two-story stucco archway spans the driveway and the home features intricate stucco work, as well as stone and tile in california arts and crafts movement style built to resemble de lemos's family's castle in spain. the hacienda was constructed between 1931 and 1941 by de lemos. it is also on the national register of historic places.in 2009 page began purchasing properties and tearing down homes adjacent to his home in palo alto to make room for a large ecohouse. the existing buildings were ""deconstructed"" and the materials donated for reuse. the ecohouse was designed to ""minimize the impact on the environment."" page worked with an arborist to replace some trees that were in poor health with others that used less water to maintain. page also applied for green point certification, with points given for use of recycled and low or no-voc (volatile organic compound) materials and for a roof garden with solar panels. the house's exterior features zinc cladding and plenty of windows, including a wall of sliding-glass doors in the rear. it includes eco-friendly elements such as permeable paving in the parking court and a pervious path through the trees on the property. the 6,000-square-foot (560mâ²) house also observes other green home design features such as organic architecture building materials and low volatile organic compound paint.

in 2011, page bought the $45-million 193-foot (59m) superyacht 'senses', which is equipped with a helipad, gym, multi-level sun decks, ten luxury suites, a crew of 14 and interior design by french designer philippe starck. 'senses' has extensive ocean exploration capabilities, the superyacht was created to explore the world's oceans in comfort and it carries a comprehensive inventory of equipment for that purpose. 'senses' was built by fr. schweers shipyard in (germany) at their berne shipyard. 'senses' features a displacement steel hull and a steel/aluminium superstructure, with teak decks. 'senses' is equipped with an ultra-modern stabilization system which reduces the free surface effect and results in a smoother cruising experience underway.

page announced on his google+ profile in may 2013 that his right vocal cord is paralyzed from a cold that he contracted the previous summer, while his left cord was paralyzed in 1999. page explained that he has been suffering from a vocal cord issue for 14 years, and, as of his may 2013 post, doctors were unable to identify the exact cause. the google+ post also revealed that page had donated a considerable sum of money to a vocal-cord nerve-function research program at the voice health institute in boston, us. the program, at massachusetts general hospital, is led by steven zeitels, the eugene b. casey professor of laryngeal surgery. an anonymous source stated that the donation exceeded $20â million.

in october 2013, ""business insider"" reported that page's paralyzed vocal cords are caused by an autoimmune disease called hashimoto's thyroiditis, and prevented him from undertaking google quarterly earnings conference calls for an indefinite period.

in november 2014, page's family foundation, the carl victor page memorial fund, reportedly holding assets in excess of a billion dollars at the end of 2013, gave $15â million to aid the effort against the ebola virus epidemic in west africa. page wrote on his google+ page that ""my wife and i just donated $15â million ... our hearts go out to everyone affected.""
"
amitabh bachchan,"
amitabh bachchan (; born inquilaab srivastava; 11 october 1942) is an indian film actor, film producer, television host, occasional playback singer and former politician. he first gained popularity in the early 1970s for films such as ""zanjeer"", ""deewaar"" and ""sholay"", and was dubbed india's ""angry young man"" for his on-screen roles in bollywood. referred to as the ""shahenshah of bollywood"", ""sadi ka mahanayak"" (hindi for, ""greatest actor of the century""), ""star of the millennium"", or ""big b"", he has since appeared in over 190 indian films in a career spanning almost five decades. bachchan is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential actors in the history of indian cinema as well as world cinema. so total was his dominance on the indian movie scene in the 1970s and 1980s that the french director franã§ois truffaut called him a ""one-man industry"". beyond the indian subcontinent, he also has a large overseas following in markets including africa (such as south africa), the middle east (especially egypt), united kingdom, russia and parts of the united states.

bachchan has won numerous accolades in his career, including four national film awards as best actor, dadasaheb phalke award as lifetime achievement award and many awards at international film festivals and award ceremonies. he has won fifteen filmfare awards and is the most nominated performer in any major acting category at filmfare, with 41 nominations overall. in addition to acting, bachchan has worked as a playback singer, film producer and television presenter. he has hosted several seasons of the game show ""kaun banega crorepati"", india's version of the game show franchise, ""who wants to be a millionaire?"". he also entered politics for a time in the 1980s.

the government of india honoured him with the padma shri in 1984, the padma bhushan in 2001 and the padma vibhushan in 2015 for his contributions to the arts. the government of france honoured him with its highest civilian honour, knight of the legion of honour, in 2007 for his exceptional career in the world of cinema and beyond. bachchan also made an appearance in a hollywood film, baz luhrmann's ""the great gatsby"" (2013), in which he played a non-indian jewish character, meyer wolfsheim.

bachchan was born in allahabad. his ancestors on his father's side came from a village called babupatti, in the raniganj tehsil, in the pratapgarh district, in the present-day state of uttar pradesh, in india. his mother, teji bachchan, was a social activist and punjabi sikh woman from lyallpur, punjab, british india (present-day faisalabad, punjab, pakistan). his father harivansh rai bachchan was a hindi-speaking kayastha hindu poet, who was also fluent in the related hindustani dialects of awadhi and urdu.

bachchan was initially named ""inquilaab"", inspired by the phrase ""inquilab zindabad"" (which translates into english as ""long live the revolution"") popularly used during the indian independence struggle. however, at the suggestion of fellow poet sumitranandan pant, harivansh rai changed the boy's name to amitabh, which, according to a ""the times of india"" article, means ""the light that will never die"".
although his surname was shrivastava, amitabh's father had adopted the pen name bachchan (""child-like"" in colloquial hindi), under which he published all of his works. it is with this last name that amitabh debuted in films and for all other practical purposes, bachchan has become the surname for all of his immediate family. bachchan's father died in 2003, and his mother in 2007.

bachchan is an alumnus of sherwood college, nainital. he later attended kirori mal college, university of delhi. he has a younger brother, ajitabh. his mother had a keen interest in theatre and was offered a feature film role, but she preferred her domestic duties. teji had some influence in amitabh bachchan's choice of career because she always insisted that he should ""take the centre stage"".

he is married to actress jaya bhaduri.

bachchan made his film debut in 1969, as a voice narrator in mrinal sen's national award-winning film ""bhuvan shome"". his first acting role was as one of the seven protagonists in the film ""saat hindustani"", directed by khwaja ahmad abbas and featuring utpal dutt, anwar ali (brother of comedian mehmood), madhu and jalal agha.

""anand"" (1971) followed, in which bachchan starred alongside rajesh khanna. his role as a doctor with a cynical view of life garnered bachchan his first filmfare ""best supporting actor"" award. he then played his first antagonist role as an infatuated lover-turned-murderer in ""parwana"" (1971). following parwana were several films including ""reshma aur shera"" (1971). during this time, he made a guest appearance in the film ""guddi"" which starred his future wife jaya bhaduri. he narrated part of the film ""bawarchi."" in 1972 he made an appearance in the road action comedy ""bombay to goa"" directed by s. ramanathan which was moderately successful. many of bachchan's films during this early period did not do well, but that was about to change.

bachchan was struggling, seen as a ""failed newcomer"" who, by the age of 30, had twelve flops and only two hits (as a lead in ""bombay to goa"" and supporting role in ""anand""). bachchan was soon discovered by screenwriter duo salim-javed, consisting of salim khan and javed akhtar. salim khan wrote the story, screenplay and script of ""zanjeer"" (1973), and conceived the ""angry young man"" persona of the lead role. javed akhtar came on board as co-writer, and prakash mehra, who saw the script as potentially groundbreaking, as the film's director. however, they were struggling to find an actor for the lead ""angry young man"" role; it was turned down by a number of actors, owing to it going against the ""romantic hero"" image dominant in the industry at the time. salim-javed soon discovered bachchan and ""saw his talent, which most makers didn't. he was exceptional, a genius actor who was in films that weren't good."" according to salim khan, they ""strongly felt that amitabh was the ideal casting for ""zanjeer"""". salim khan introduced bachchan to prakash mehra, and salim-javed insisted that bachchan be cast for the role.

""zanjeer"" was a crime film with violent action, in sharp contrast to the romantically themed films that had generally preceded it, and it established amitabh in a new personaâthe ""angry young man"" of bollywood cinema. he earned his first filmfare award nomination for best actor, with ""filmfare"" later considering this one of the most iconic performances of bollywood history. the film was a huge success and one of the highest-grossing films of that year, breaking bachchan's dry spell at the box office and making him a star. it was the first of many collaborations between salim-javed and amitabh bachchan; salim-javed wrote many of their subsequent scripts with bachchan in mind for the lead role, and insisted on him being cast for their later films, including blockbusters such as ""deewaar"" (1975) and ""sholay"" (1975). salim khan also introduced bachchan to director manmohan desai with whom he formed a long and successful association, alongside prakash mehra and yash chopra. eventually, bachchan became one of the most successful leading men of the film industry. bachchan's portrayal of the wronged hero fighting a crooked system and circumstances of deprivation in films like ""zanjeer"", ""deeewar"", ""trishul"", ""kaala patthar"" and ""shakti"" resonated with the masses of the time, especially the youth who harboured a simmering discontent owing to social ills such as poverty, hunger, unemployment, corruption, social inequality and the brutal excesses of the emergency. this led to bachchan being dubbed as ""angry young man"", a journalistic catchphrase which became a metaphor for the dormant rage, frustration, restlessness, sense of rebellion and anti-establishment disposition of an entire generation, prevalent in 1970s india.

the year 1973 was also when he married jaya, and around this time they appeared in several films together: not only ""zanjeer"" but also subsequent films such as ""abhimaan"", which was released only a month after their marriage and was also successful at the box office. later, bachchan played the role of vikram, once again along with rajesh khanna, in the film ""namak haraam"", a social drama directed by hrishikesh mukherjee and scripted by biresh chatterjee addressing themes of friendship. his supporting role won him his second filmfare ""best supporting actor"" award.

in 1974, bachchan made several guest appearances in films such as ""kunwara baap"" and ""dost"", before playing a supporting role in ""roti kapda aur makaan"". the film, directed and written by manoj kumar, addressed themes of honesty in the face of oppression and financial and emotional hardship, and was the top-earning film of 1974. bachchan then played the leading role in the film ""majboor"". the film was a success at the box office.

in 1975, he starred in a variety of film genres, from the comedy ""chupke chupke"" and the crime drama ""faraar"" to the romantic drama ""mili"". this was also the year in which bachchan starred in two films regarded as important in hindi cinema history, both written by salim-javed, who again insisted on casting bachchan. the first was ""deewaar"", directed by yash chopra, where he worked with shashi kapoor, nirupa roy, parveen babi, and neetu singh, and earned another filmfare nomination for best actor. the film became a major hit at the box office in 1975, ranking in at number four. ""indiatimes movies"" ranks ""deewaar"" amongst the ""top 25 must see bollywood films"". the other, released on 15 august 1975, was ""sholay"", which became the highest-grossing film ever in india at the time, in which bachchan played the role of jaidev. ""deewaar"" and ""sholay"" are often credited with exalting bachchan to the heights of superstardom, two years after he became a star with ""zanjeer"", and consolidating his domination of the industry throughout the 1970s and 1980s. in 1999, bbc india declared ""sholay"" the ""film of the millennium"" and, like ""deewar"", it has been cited by ""indiatimes movies"" as amongst the ""top 25 must see bollywood films"". in that same year, the judges of the 50th annual filmfare awards awarded it with the special distinction award called the filmfare best film of 50 years.

in 1976, he was cast by yash chopra in the romantic family drama ""kabhie kabhie"". bachchan starred as a young poet, amit malhotra, who falls deeply in love with a beautiful young girl named pooja (rakhee gulzar) who ends up marrying someone else (shashi kapoor). the film was notable for portraying bachchan as a romantic hero, a far cry from his ""angry young man"" roles like ""zanjeer"" and ""deewar"". the film evoked a favourable response from critics and audiences alike. bachchan was again nominated for the filmfare best actor award for his role in the film. that same year he played a double role in the hit ""adalat"" as father and son. in 1977, he won his first filmfare best actor award for his performance in ""amar akbar anthony"", in which he played the third lead opposite vinod khanna and rishi kapoor as anthony gonsalves. the film was the highest-grossing film of that year. his other successes that year include ""parvarish"" and ""khoon pasina"".

he once again resumed double roles in films such as ""kasme vaade"" (1978) as amit and shankar and ""don"" (1978) playing the characters of don, a leader of an underworld gang and his look-alike vijay. his performance won him his second filmfare best actor award. he also gave towering performances in yash chopra's ""trishul"" and prakash mehra's ""muqaddar ka sikandar"" both of which earned him further filmfare best actor nominations. 1978 is arguably considered his most successful year at the box office since all of his six releases the same year, namely ""muqaddar ka sikandar"", ""trishul"", ""don"", ""kasme vaade"", ""ganga ki saugandh"" and ""besharam"" were massive successes, the former three being the consecutive highest-grossing films of the year, remarkably releasing within a couple of months of each other, a rare feat in indian cinema.

in 1979, bachchan starred in ""suhaag"" which was the highest earning film of that year. in the same year he also enjoyed critical acclaim and commercial success with films like ""mr. natwarlal"", ""kaala patthar"", ""the great gambler"" and ""manzil"". amitabh was required to use his singing voice for the first time in a song from the film ""mr. natwarlal"" in which he starred with rekha. bachchan's performance in the film saw him nominated for both the filmfare best actor award and the ""filmfare award for best male playback singer"". he also received best actor nomination for ""kaala patthar"" and then went on to be nominated again in 1980 for the raj khosla directed film ""dostana"", in which he starred opposite shatrughan sinha and zeenat aman. ""dostana"" proved to be the top-grossing film of 1980. in 1981, he starred in yash chopra's melodrama film ""silsila"", where he starred alongside his wife jaya and also rekha. other successful films of this period include ""shaan"" (1980), ""ram balram"" (1980), ""naseeb"" (1981), ""lawaaris"" (1981), ""kaalia"" (1981), ""yaarana"" (1981), ""barsaat ki ek raat"" (1981) and ""shakti"" (1982), also starring dilip kumar.

in 1982, he played double roles in the musical ""satte pe satta"" and action drama"" desh premee"" which succeeded at the box office along with mega hits like action comedy ""namak halaal"", action drama ""khud-daar"" and the critically acclaimed drama ""bemisal"". in 1983, he played a triple role in ""mahaan"" which was not as successful as his previous films. other releases during that year included ""nastik"", ""andha kanoon"" (in which he had an extended guest appearance) which were hits and ""pukar"" was an average grosser during a stint in politics from 1984 to 1987, his completed films ""mard"" (1985) and ""aakhree raasta"" (1986) were released and were major hits.

on 26 july 1982, while filming ""coolie"", in the university campus in bangalore, bachchan suffered a near-fatal intestinal injury during the filming of a fight scene with co-actor puneet issar. bachchan was performing his own stunts in the film and one scene required him to fall onto a table and then on the ground. however, as he jumped towards the table, the corner of the table struck his abdomen, resulting in a splenic rupture from which he lost a significant amount of blood. he required an emergency splenectomy and remained critically ill in hospital for many months, at times close to death. the overwhelming public response included prayers in temples and offers to sacrifice limbs to save him, while later, there were long queues of well-wishing fans outside the hospital where he was recuperating.

nevertheless, he resumed filming later that year after a long period of recuperation. the film was released in 1983, and partly due to the huge publicity of bachchan's accident, the film was a box office success and the top-grossing film of that year.

the director, manmohan desai, altered the ending of ""coolie"" after bachchan's accident. bachchan's character was originally intended to have been killed off but after the change of script, the character lived in the end. it would have been inappropriate, said desai, for the man who had just fended off death in real life to be killed on screen. also, in the released film the footage of the fight scene is frozen at the critical moment, and a caption appears onscreen marking this as the instant of the actor's injury and the ensuing publicity of the accident.

later, he was diagnosed with myasthenia gravis. his illness made him feel weak both mentally and physically and he decided to quit films and venture into politics. at this time he became pessimistic, expressing concern with how a new film would be received, and stating before every release, ""yeh film to flop hogi!"" (""this film will flop"").

after a three-year stint in politics from 1984 to 1987, bachchan returned to films in 1988, playing the title role in ""shahenshah"", which was a box office success. after the success of his comeback film however, his star power began to wane as all of his subsequent films like ""jaadugar"", ""toofan"" and ""main azaad hoon"" (all released in 1989) failed at the box office. successes during this period like the crime drama ""aaj ka arjun"" (1990) and action crime drama ""hum"" (1991), for which he won his third filmfare best actor award, looked like they might reverse the trend, but this momentum was short-lived and his string of box office failures continued. notably, despite the lack of hits, it was during this era that bachchan won his first national film award for best actor for his performance as a mafia don in the 1990 cult film ""agneepath."" these years would see his last on-screen appearances for some time. after the release of the critically acclaimed epic ""khuda gawah"" in 1992, bachchan went into semi-retirement for five years. with the exception of the delayed release of ""insaniyat"" (1994), which was also a box office failure, bachchan did not appear in any new releases for five years.

bachchan turned producer during his temporary retirement period, setting up amitabh bachchan corporation, ltd. (abcl) in 1996. abcl's strategy was to introduce products and services covering an entire cross-section of india's entertainment industry. abcl's operations were mainstream commercial film production and distribution, audio cassettes and video discs, production and marketing of television software, and celebrity and event management. soon after the company was launched in 1996, the first film it produced was ""tere mere sapne,"" which was a moderate success and launched the careers of actors like arshad warsi and southern film star simran.

in 1997, bachchan attempted to make his acting comeback with the film ""mrityudata"", produced by abcl. though ""mrityudaata"" attempted to reprise bachchan's earlier success as an action hero, the film was a failure both financially and critically. abcl was the main sponsor of the ""1996 miss world beauty pageant"", bangalore, but lost millions. the fiasco and the consequent legal battles surrounding abcl and various entities after the event, coupled with the fact that abcl was reported to have overpaid most of its top-level managers, eventually led to its financial and operational collapse in 1997. the company went into administration and was later declared a failed company by the indian industries board. the bombay high court, in april 1999, restrained bachchan from selling off his bombay bungalow 'prateeksha' and two flats till the pending loan recovery cases of canara bank were disposed of. bachchan had, however, pleaded that he had mortgaged his bungalow to raise funds for his company.

bachchan attempted to revive his acting career, and eventually had commercial success with ""bade miyan chote miyan"" (1998) and ""major saab"" (1998), and received positive reviews for ""sooryavansham"" (1999), but other films such as ""lal baadshah"" (1999) and ""hindustan ki kasam"" (1999) were box office failures.

in 2000, amitabh bachchan appeared in yash chopra's box-office hit, ""mohabbatein"", directed by aditya chopra. he played a stern, elder figure who rivalled the character of shahrukh khan. his role won him his third filmfare best supporting actor award. other hits followed, with bachchan appearing as an older family patriarch in """" (2001), ""kabhi khushi kabhie gham..."" (2001) and ""baghban"" (2003). as an actor, he continued to perform in a range of characters, receiving critical praise for his performances in ""aks"" (2001), ""aankhen"" (2002), ""kaante"" (2002), ""khakee"" (2004) and ""dev"" (2004).
his performance in ""aks"" won him his first filmfare critics award for best actor.

one project that did particularly well for bachchan was sanjay leela bhansali's ""black"" (2005). the film starred bachchan as an ageing teacher of a deaf-blind girl and followed their relationship. his performance was unanimously praised by critics and audiences and won him his second national film award for best actor, his fourth filmfare best actor award and his second filmfare critics award for best actor. taking advantage of this resurgence, amitabh began endorsing a variety of products and services, appearing in many television and billboard advertisements. in 2005 and 2006, he starred with his son abhishek in the films ""bunty aur babli"" (2005), the ""godfather"" tribute ""sarkar"" (2005), and ""kabhi alvida naa kehna"" (2006). all of them were successful at the box office. his later releases in 2006 and early 2007 were ""baabul"" (2006), ""ekalavya"" and ""nishabd"" (2007), which failed to do well at the box office but his performances in each of them were praised by critics.

in may 2007, two of his films: the romantic comedy ""cheeni kum"" and the multi-starrer action drama ""shootout at lokhandwala"" were released. ""shootout at lokhandwala"" did well at the box office and was declared a hit in india, while ""cheeni kum"" picked up after a slow start and was a success. a remake of his biggest hit, ""sholay"" (1975), entitled ""ram gopal varma ki aag"", released in august of that same year and proved to be a major commercial failure in addition to its poor critical reception. the year also marked bachchan's first appearance in an english-language film, rituparno ghosh's ""the last lear"", co-starring arjun rampal and preity zinta. the film premiered at the 2007 toronto international film festival on 9 september 2007. he received positive reviews from critics who hailed his performance as his best ever since ""black"".
bachchan was slated to play a supporting role in his first international film, ""shantaram"", directed by mira nair and starring hollywood actor johnny depp in the lead. the film was due to begin filming in february 2008 but due to the writer's strike, was pushed to september 2008. the film is currently ""shelved"" indefinitely.

vivek sharma's ""bhoothnath"", in which he plays the title role as a ghost, was released on 9 may 2008. ""sarkar raj"", the sequel of the 2005 film ""sarkar"", released in june 2008 and received a positive response at the box office. ""paa"", which released at the end of 2009 was a highly anticipated project as it saw him playing his own son abhishek's progeria-affected 13-year-old son, and it opened to favourable reviews, particularly towards bachchan's performance and was one of the top-grossing films of 2009. it won him his third national film award for best actor and fifth filmfare best actor award. in 2010, he debuted in malayalam film through ""kandahar"", directed by major ravi and co-starring mohanlal. the film was based on the hijacking incident of the indian airlines flight 814. bachchan declined any remuneration for this film.

in 2013 he made his hollywood debut in ""the great gatsby"" making a special appearance opposite leonardo dicaprio and tobey maguire. in 2014, he played the role of the friendly ghost in the sequel ""bhoothnath returns"". the next year, he played the role of a grumpy father suffering from chronic constipation in the critically acclaimed ""piku"" which was also one of the biggest hits of 2015. a review in ""daily news and analysis"" (dna) summarised bachchan's performance as ""the heart and soul of piku clearly belong to amitabh bachchan who is in his elements. his performance in piku, without doubt, finds a place among the top 10 in his illustrious career."" rachel saltz wrote for the new york times, """"piku,"" an offbeat hindi comedy, would have you contemplate the intestines and mortality of one bhashkor banerji and the actor who plays him, amitabh bachchan. bhashkor's life and conversation may revolve around his constipation and fussy hypochondria, but there's no mistaking the scene-stealing energy that mr. bachchan, india's erstwhile angry young man, musters for his new role of cranky old man."" well known indian critic rajeev masand wrote on his website, ""bachchan is pretty terrific as bhashkor, who reminds you of that oddball uncle that you nevertheless have a soft spot for. he bickers with the maids, harrows his hapless helper, and expects that piku stay unmarried so she can attend to him. at one point, to ward off a possible suitor, he casually mentions that his daughter isn't a virgin; that she's financially independent and sexually independent too. bachchan embraces the character's many idiosyncrasies, never once slipping into caricature while all along delivering big laughs thanks to his spot-on comic timing. ""the guardian"" summed up, ""bachchan seizes upon his cranky character part, making bashkor as garrulously funny in his theories on caste and marriage as his system is backed-up."" the performance won bachchan his fourth national film award for best actor and his third filmfare critics award for best actor.

in 2016, he appeared in the women centric courtroom drama film ""pink"" which was highly praised by critics and with an increasingly good word of mouth, was a resounding success at the domestic and overseas box office. bachchan's performance in the film received acclaim. according to raja sen of rediff.com, ""amitabh bachchan, a retired lawyer suffering from bipolar disorder, takes up cudgels on behalf of the girls, delivering courtroom blows with pugilistic grace. like we know from prakash mehra movies, into each life some bachchan must fall. the girls hang on to him with incredulous desperation, and he bats for them with all he has. at one point meenal hangs by bachchan's elbow, words entirely unnecessary. bachchan towers through pink â the way he bellows ""et cetera"" is alone worth having the heavy-hitter at playâbut there are softer moments like one where he appears to have dozed off in court, or where he lays his head by his convalescent wife's bedside and needs his hair ruffled and his conviction validated."" writing for hindustan times, noted film critic and author anupama chopra said of bachchan's performance, ""a special salute to amitabh bachchan, who imbues his character with a tragic majesty. bachchan towers in every sense, but without a hint of showboating. meena iyer of the times of india wrote, ""the performances are pitch-perfect with bachchan leading the way. writing for ndtv, troy ribeiro of indo-asian news service (ians) stated, 'amitabh bachchan as deepak sehgall, the aged defence lawyer, shines as always, in a restrained, but powerful performance. his histrionics come primarily in the form of his well-modulated baritone, conveying his emotions and of course, from the well-written lines.' mike mccahill of the guardian remarked, ""among an electric ensemble, tapsee pannu, kirti kulhari and andrea tariang give unwavering voice to the girlsâ struggles; amitabh bachchan brings his moral authority to bear as their sole legal ally.

in 2017, he appeared in the third instalment of the sarkar film series: ram gopal varma's ""sarkar 3"". that year, he started filming for the swashbuckling action adventure film ""thugs of hindostan"" with aamir khan, katrina kaif and fatima sana shaikh which released in november 2018. he co-starred with rishi kapoor in ""102 not out"", a comedy-drama film directed by umesh shukla based on a gujarati play of the same name written by saumya joshi. this film released in may 2018 and reunited him with kapoor onscreen after a gap of twenty-seven years. in october 2017, it was announced that bachchan will appear in ayan mukerji's ""brahmastra"", alongside ranbir kapoor and alia bhatt.

in 1984, bachchan took a break from acting and briefly entered politics in support of a long-time family friend, rajiv gandhi. he contested allahabad's seat for the 8th lok sabha against h. n. bahuguna, former chief minister of uttar pradesh and won by one of the highest victory margins in general election history (68.2% of the vote). his political career, however, was short-lived: he resigned after three years, calling politics a cesspool. the resignation followed the implication of bachchan and his brother in the ""bofors scandal"" by a newspaper, which he vowed to take to court. bachchan was eventually found not guilty of involvement in the ordeal. he was framed in the scam and falsely alleged. this was cleared by swedish police chief sten lindstrom.

his old friend, amar singh, helped him during the financial crisis caused by the failure of his company, abcl. thereafter bachchan started supporting the samajwadi party, the political party to which amar singh belonged. furthermore, jaya bachchan joined the samajwadi party and represented the party as an mp in the rajya sabha. bachchan has continued to do favours for the samajwadi party, including appearing in advertisements and political campaigns. these activities have recently got him into trouble in the indian courts for false claims after a previous incident of submission of legal papers by him, stating that he is a farmer.

a 15-year press ban against bachchan was imposed during his peak acting years by ""stardust"" and some of the other film magazines. in defence, bachchan claimed to have banned the press from entering his sets until late 1989.

bachchan has been accused of using the slogan ""blood for blood"" in the context of the 1984 anti-sikh riots. bachchan has denied the allegation. in october 2014, bachchan was summoned by a court in los angeles for ""allegedly instigating violence against the sikh community"".

bill gates,"
william henry gates iii (born october 28, 1955) is an american business magnate, investor, author, philanthropist, and humanitarian. he is best known as the principal founder of microsoft corporation. during his career at microsoft, gates held the positions of chairman, ceo and chief software architect, while also being the largest individual shareholder until may 2014.

born and raised in seattle, washington, gates launched microsoft with childhood friend paul allen in 1975 in albuquerque, new mexico; it went on to become the world's largest personal computer software company. gates led the company as chairman and ceo until stepping down as ceo in january 2000, but he remained chairman and became chief software architect. in june 2006, gates announced that he would be transitioning to a part-time role at microsoft and full-time work at the bill & melinda gates foundation, the private charitable foundation that he and his wife, melinda gates, established in 2000. he gradually transferred his duties to ray ozzie and craig mundie. he stepped down as chairman of microsoft in february 2014 and assumed a new post as technology adviser to support the newly appointed ceo satya nadella.

gates is one of the best-known entrepreneurs of the personal computer revolution. he has been criticized for his business tactics, which have been considered anti-competitive. this opinion has been upheld by numerous court rulings.

since 1987, gates has been included in the ""forbes"" list of the world's wealthiest people, an index of the wealthiest documented individuals, excluding and ranking against those with wealth that is not able to be completely ascertained. from 1995 to 2017, he held the ""forbes"" title of the richest person in the world all but four of those years, and held it consistently from march 2014 to july 2017, with an estimated net worth of us$89.9â billion . however, on july 27, 2017, and since october 27, 2017, he has been surpassed by amazon founder and ceo jeff bezos, who had an estimated net worth of us$90.6â billion at the time. , gates had a net worth of $95.4 billion, making him the second-richest person in the world, behind bezos.

later in his career and since leaving microsoft, gates pursued a number of philanthropic endeavors. he donated large amounts of money to various charitable organizations and scientific research programs through the bill & melinda gates foundation, reported to be the world's largest private charity. in 2009, gates and warren buffett founded the giving pledge, whereby they and other billionaires pledge to give at least half of their wealth to philanthropy. the foundation works to save lives and improve global health, and is working with rotary international to eliminate polio.

gates was born in seattle, washington on october 28, 1955. he is the son of william h. gates sr. (b. 1925) and mary maxwell gates (1929â1994). his ancestry includes english, german, and irish/scots-irish. his father was a prominent lawyer, and his mother served on the board of directors for first interstate bancsystem and the united way of america. gates' maternal grandfather was j. w. maxwell, a national bank president. gates has an older sister kristi (kristianne) and a younger sister libby. he is the fourth of his name in his family but is known as william gates iii or ""trey"" because his father had the ""ii"" suffix. the family lived in the sand point area of seattle in a home that was damaged by a rare tornado when gates was seven years old. early in his life, gates observed that his parents wanted him to pursue a law career. when he was young, his family regularly attended a church of the congregational christian churches, a protestant reformed denomination. gates was small for his age and was bullied as a child. he preferred to stay in his room where he would shout ""i'm thinking"" when his mother asked what he was doing. the family encouraged competition; one visitor reported that ""it didn't matter whether it was hearts or pickleball or swimming to the dock; there was always a reward for winning and there was always a penalty for losing"".

at 13, he enrolled in the private lakeside prep school, and he wrote his first software program. when he was in the eighth grade, the mothers' club at the school used proceeds from lakeside school's rummage sale to buy a teletype model 33 asr terminal and a block of computer time on a general electric (ge) computer for the students. gates took an interest in programming the ge system in basic, and he was excused from math classes to pursue his interest. he wrote his first computer program on this machine, an implementation of tic-tac-toe which allowed users to play games against the computer. gates was fascinated by the machine and how it would always execute software code perfectly. after the mothers club donation was exhausted, he and other students sought time on systems including dec pdp minicomputers. one of these systems was a pdp-10 belonging to computer center corporation (ccc) which banned gates, paul allen, ric weiland, and gates' best friend kent evans for the summer after it caught them exploiting bugs in the operating system to obtain free computer time.

the four students had formed the lakeside programmers club to make money. at the end of the ban, they offered to find bugs in ccc's software in exchange for extra computer time. rather than use the system remotely via teletype, gates went to ccc's offices and studied source code for various programs that ran on the system, including fortran, lisp, and machine language. the arrangement with ccc continued until 1970, when the company went out of business. the following year, information sciences, inc. hired the four students to write a payroll program in cobol, providing them computer time and royalties. gates wrote the school's student information system software to schedule students in classes, and he modified the code so that he was placed in classes with ""a disproportionate number of interesting girls.""

at 17, gates formed a venture with allen called traf-o-data to make traffic counters based on the intel 8008 processor. in 1972, he served as a congressional page in the house of representatives. he was a national merit scholar when he graduated from lakeside school in 1973. he scored 1590 out of 1600 on the scholastic aptitude tests (sat) and enrolled at harvard college in the autumn of 1973. he chose a pre-law major but took mathematics and graduate level computer science courses. while at harvard, he met fellow student steve ballmer. gates left harvard after two years while ballmer stayed and graduated ""magna cum laude"". ballmer succeeded gates as microsoft's ceo years later and maintained that position from 2000 until his resignation in 2014.

gates devised an algorithm for pancake sorting as a solution to one of a series of unsolved problems presented in a combinatorics class by professor harry lewis. his solution held the record as the fastest version for over 30 years; its successor is faster by only one percent. his solution was formalized in a published paper in collaboration with harvard computer scientist christos papadimitriou.

gates did not have a definite study plan while he was a student at harvard, and he spent a lot of time using the school's computers. he remained in contact with paul allen, and he joined him at honeywell during the summer of 1974. the mits altair 8800 was released the following year based on the intel 8080 cpu, and gates and allen saw this as the opportunity to start their own computer software company. gates dropped out of harvard at this time. he had talked over this decision with his parents, who were supportive of him after seeing how much he wanted to start his own company. he explained his decision to leave harvard: ""if things hadn't worked out, i could always go back to school. i was officially on leave.""

gates read the january 1975 issue of ""popular electronics"" which demonstrated the altair 8800, and he contacted micro instrumentation and telemetry systems (mits) to inform them that he and others were working on a basic interpreter for the platform. in reality, gates and allen did not have an altair and had not written code for it; they merely wanted to gauge mits's interest. mits president ed roberts agreed to meet them for a demonstration, and over the course of a few weeks they developed an altair emulator that ran on a minicomputer, and then the basic interpreter. the demonstration was held at mits's offices in albuquerque, new mexico; it was a success and resulted in a deal with mits to distribute the interpreter as altair basic. mits hired allen, and gates took a leave of absence from harvard to work with him at mits in november 1975. allen named their partnership ""micro-soft"", a combination of ""microcomputer"" and ""software"", and their first office was in albuquerque. they dropped the hyphen within a year, and they registered the trade name ""microsoft"" on november 26, 1976 with the secretary of the state of new mexico. gates never returned to harvard to complete his studies.

microsoft's altair basic was popular with computer hobbyists, but gates discovered that a pre-market copy had leaked out and was being widely copied and distributed. in february 1976, he wrote an open letter to hobbyists in the mits newsletter in which he asserted that more than 90 percent of the users of microsoft altair basic had not paid microsoft for it and the altair ""hobby market"" was in danger of eliminating the incentive for any professional developers to produce, distribute, and maintain high-quality software. this letter was unpopular with many computer hobbyists, but gates persisted in his belief that software developers should be able to demand payment. microsoft became independent of mits in late 1976, and it continued to develop programming language software for various systems. the company moved from albuquerque to bellevue, washington on january 1, 1979.

during microsoft's early years, all employees had broad responsibility for the company's business. gates oversaw the business details, but he also continued to write code. he claims that he personally reviewed every line of code that the company produced, and often rewrote parts of it as he saw fit.

ibm, the leading supplier of computer equipment to commercial enterprises at the time, approached microsoft in july 1980 concerning software for its upcoming personal computer, the ibm pc. ibm first proposed that microsoft write the basic interpreter. ibm's representatives also mentioned that they needed an operating system, and gates referred them to digital research (dri), makers of the widely used cp/m operating system. ibm's discussions with digital research went poorly, however, and they did not reach a licensing agreement. ibm representative jack sams mentioned the licensing difficulties during a subsequent meeting with gates and asked if microsoft could provide an operating system. a few weeks later, gates and allen proposed using 86-dos, an operating system similar to cp/m, that tim paterson of seattle computer products (scp) had made for hardware similar to the pc. microsoft made a deal with scp to be the exclusive licensing agent of 86-dos, and later the full owner. microsoft employed paterson to adapt the operating system for the pc and delivered it to ibm as pc dos for a one-time fee of $50,000.

rather than the contract itself, which earned microsoft a relatively small fee, the prestige brought to microsoft by ibm's adoption of their operating system was the origin of microsoft's transformation from a small business to the world's leading software company. gates had not offered to transfer the copyright on the operating system to ibm because he believed that other personal computer makers would clone ibm's pc hardware. they did, making the ibm-compatible pc, running dos, a de-facto standard. the sales of ms-dos (the version of dos sold to customers other than ibm) made microsoft a major player in the industry. the press quickly identified microsoft as being very influential on the ibm pc. ""pc magazine"" asked if gates was ""the man behind the machine?"". 
gates oversaw microsoft's company restructuring on june 25, 1981, which re-incorporated the company in washington state and made gates the president and chairman of the board.

microsoft launched its first retail version of microsoft windows on november 20, 1985. in august of the following year, the company struck a deal with ibm to develop a separate operating system called os/2. although the two companies successfully developed the first version of the new system, the partnership deteriorated due to mounting creative differences.

gates had primary responsibility for microsoft's product strategy from the company's founding in 1975 until 2006. he gained a reputation for being distant from others; an industry executive complained in 1981 that ""gates is notorious for not being reachable by phone and for not returning phone calls."" an atari executive recalled that he showed gates a game and defeated him 35 of 37 times. when they met again a month later, gates ""won or tied every game. he had studied the game until he solved it. that is a competitor"".

gates met regularly with microsoft's senior managers and program managers, and the managers described him as being verbally combative. he also berated them for perceived holes in their business strategies or proposals that placed the company's long-term interests at risk. he interrupted presentations with such comments as ""that's the stupidest thing i've ever heard"" and ""why don't you just give up your options and join the peace corps?"" the target of his outburst would then have to defend the proposal in detail until gates was fully convinced. when subordinates appeared to be procrastinating, he was known to remark sarcastically, ""i'll do it over the weekend.""

during microsoft's early history, gates was an active software developer, particularly in the company's programming language products, but his primary role in most of the company's history was as a manager and executive. he has not officially been on a development team since working on the trs-80 model 100, but he wrote code that shipped with the company's products as late as 1989. jerry pournelle wrote in 1985 when gates announced microsoft excel: ""bill gates likes the program, not because it's going to make him a lot of money (although i'm sure it will do that), but because it's a neat hack.""

on june 15, 2006, gates announced that he would transition out of his role at microsoft to dedicate more time to philanthropy. he divided his responsibilities between two successors when he placed ray ozzie in charge of management and craig mundie in charge of long-term product strategy.

gates approved of many decisions that led to antitrust litigation over microsoft's business practices. in the 1998 ""united states v. microsoft"" case, gates gave deposition testimony which several journalists characterized as evasive. he argued with examiner david boies over the contextual meaning of words such as ""compete"", ""concerned"", and ""we"". the judge and observers in the courtroom were seen laughing at various points during the deposition. ""businessweek"" reported:

gates later said that he had simply resisted attempts by boies to mischaracterize his words and actions. ""did i fence with boies? â¦ i plead guiltyâ¦ rudeness to boies in the first degree."" despite gates' denials, the judge ruled that microsoft had committed monopolization and tying, and blocking competition, both in violation of the sherman antitrust act.

since leaving day-to-day operations at microsoft, gates has continued his philanthropy and works on other projects.

according to the bloomberg billionaires index, gates was the world's highest-earning billionaire in 2013, as his net worth increased by us$15.8â billion to us$78.5â billion. , most of gates' assets are held in cascade investment llc, an entity through which he owns stakes in numerous businesses, including four seasons hotels and resorts, and corbis corp. on february 4, 2014, gates stepped down as chairman of microsoft to become technology advisor alongside new ceo satya nadella.

gates provided his perspective on a range of issues in a substantial interview that was published in the march 27, 2014 issue of ""rolling stone"" magazine. in the interview, gates provided his perspective on climate change, his charitable activities, various tech companies and people involved in them, and the state of america. in response to a question about his greatest fear when he looks 50 years into the future, gates stated: ""...there'll be some really bad things that'll happen in the next 50 or 100 years, but hopefully none of them on the scale of, say, a million people that you didn't expect to die from a pandemic, or nuclear or bioterrorism."" gates also identified innovation as the ""real driver of progress"" and pronounced that ""america's way better today than it's ever been.""

gates has expressed concern about the potential harms of superintelligence; in a reddit ""ask me anything"", he stated that

in a march 2015 interview, with baidu's ceo, robin li, gates claimed he would ""highly recommend"" nick bostrom's recent work, """".

in march 2018, gates met at his home in seattle with mohammed bin salman, the reformist crown prince and de facto ruler of saudi arabia to discuss investment opportunities for saudi vision 2030.

in an interview on stage in 2019, gates admitted that losing the mobile os space to android was his biggest mistake. he stated that it was within their skillset of being the dominant mobile operating system, but the company was distracted during that period because of the ongoing anti-trust litigation.

in 2019, bill gates became an advisory board member of the bloomberg new economy forum.

gates studied the work of andrew carnegie and john d. rockefeller, and donated some of his microsoft stock in 1994 to create the ""william h. gates foundation."" in 2000, gates and his wife combined three family foundations and gates donated stock valued at $5 billion to create the charitable bill & melinda gates foundation, which was identified by the funds for ngos company in 2013, as the world's wealthiest charitable foundation, with assets reportedly valued at more than $34.6â billion. the foundation allows benefactors to access information that shows how its money is being spent, unlike other major charitable organizations such as the wellcome trust. gates, through his foundation, also donated $20 million to carnegie mellon university for a new building to be named gates center for computer science which opened in 2009.

gates has credited the generosity and extensive philanthropy of david rockefeller as a major influence. gates and his father met with rockefeller several times, and their charity work is partly modeled on the rockefeller family's philanthropic focus, whereby they are interested in tackling the global problems that are ignored by governments and other organizations. , bill and melinda gates were the second-most generous philanthropists in america, having given over $28â billion to charity; the couple plan to eventually donate 95 percent of their wealth to charity.

the foundation is organized into four program areas: global development division, global health division, united states division, and global policy & advocacy division. the foundation supports the use of genetically modified organisms in agricultural development. specifically, the foundation is supporting the international rice research institute in developing golden rice, a genetically modified rice variant used to combat vitamin a deficiency.

melinda gates suggested that people should emulate the philanthropic efforts of the salwen family, who sold their home and gave away half of its value, as detailed in their book, ""the power of half"". gates and his wife invited joan salwen to seattle to speak about what the family had done, and on december 9, 2010, bill and melinda gates and investor warren buffett each signed a commitment they called the ""giving pledge"", which is a commitment by all three to donate at least half of their wealth, over the course of time, to charity.

gates has also provided personal donations to educational institutions. in 1999, gates donated $20â million to the massachusetts institute of technology for the construction of a computer laboratory named the ""william h. gates building"" that was designed by architect frank gehry. while microsoft had previously given financial support to the institution, this was the first personal donation received from gates.

the maxwell dworkin laboratory of the harvard john a. paulson school of engineering and applied sciences is named after the mothers of both gates and microsoft president steven a. ballmer, both of whom were students (ballmer was a member of the school's graduating class of 1977, while gates left his studies for microsoft), and donated funds for the laboratory's construction. gates also donated $6â million to the construction of the gates computer science building, completed in january 1996, on the campus of stanford university. the building contains the computer science department and the computer systems laboratory (csl) of stanford's engineering department.

on august 15, 2014, bill gates posted a video of himself on facebook in which he is seen performing the ice bucket challenge. gates posted the video after facebook founder mark zuckerberg challenged him to do so in order to raise awareness for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

since about 2005, bill gates and his foundation have taken an interest in solving global sanitation problems. for example, they announced the ""reinvent the toilet challenge"", which has received considerable media interest. to raise awareness for the topic of sanitation and possible solutions, gates drank water that was ""produced from human feces"" in 2014â â in fact it was produced from a sewage sludge treatment process called the omni processor. in early 2015, he also appeared with jimmy fallon on ""the tonight show"" and challenged him to see if he could taste the difference between this reclaimed water or bottled water.

in november 2017, gates said he would give $50â million to the dementia discovery fund, a venture capital that seeks treatment for alzheimer's disease. he also pledged an additional $50â million to start-up ventures working in alzheimer's research.

bill and melinda gates have said that they intend to leave their three children $10â million each as their inheritance. with only $30â million kept in the family, they appear to be on a course to give away about 99.96 percent of their wealth. on august 25, 2018, gates distributed $600,000 through his melinda and gates foundation via unicef which is helping flood affected victims in kerala, india.

in 2007, the ""los angeles times"" criticized the foundation for investing its assets in companies that have been accused of worsening poverty, polluting heavily, and pharmaceutical companies that do not sell to developing countries.
in response to press criticism, the foundation announced a review of its investments to assess social responsibility. it subsequently canceled the review and stood by its policy of investing for maximum return, while using voting rights to influence company practices. the gates millennium scholars program, which was established to provide academic scholarships for high-achieving ethnic minority students, was criticized by republican ernest w. lefever for its exclusion of white students. the scholarship program is administered by the united negro college fund. in 2014, bill gates sparked a protest in vancouver when he decided to donate $50 million to unaids through the bill & melinda gates foundation for the purpose of mass circumcision in zambia and swaziland.

on april 29, 2017, bill gates partnered with swiss tennis legend roger federer in play in the match for africa 4, a noncompetitive tennis match at a sold-out key arena in seattle. the event was in support of roger federer foundation's charity efforts in africa. federer and gates played against john isner, the top-ranked american player for much of this decade, and mike mccready, the lead guitarist for pearl jam. gates and federer won the match 6 to 4. overall, they raised $2â million for children in africa. the following year, gates and federer returned to play in the match for africa 5 on march 5, 2018, at san jose's sap center. their opponents were jack sock, one of the top american players and a grand slam winner in doubles, and savannah guthrie, a co-anchor for nbc's ""today"" show. gates and federer recorded their second match victory together by a score of 6â3 and the event raised over $2.5 million.


gates married melinda french on a golf course on the hawaiian island of lanai on january 1, 1994. they have three children. the family resides in xanadu 2.0, an earth-sheltered mansion in the side of a hill overlooking lake washington in medina, washington. in 2009, property taxes on the mansion were reported to be us$1.063 million, on a total assessed value of us$147.5 million. the estate has a swimming pool with an underwater music system, as well as a gym and a dining room.

in an interview with ""rolling stone"", gates stated in regard to his faith: ""the moral systems of religion, i think, are super important. we've raised our kids in a religious way; they've gone to the catholic church that melinda goes to and i participate in. i've been very lucky, and therefore i owe it to try and reduce the inequity in the world. and that's kind of a religious belief. i mean, it's at least a moral belief.""

in the same interview, gates said: ""i agree with people like richard dawkins that mankind felt the need for creation myths. before we really began to understand disease and the weather and things like that, we sought false explanations for them. now science has filled in some of the realmâ â not allâ â that religion used to fill. but the mystery and the beauty of the world is overwhelmingly amazing, and there's no scientific explanation of how it came about. to say that it was generated by random numbers, that does seem, you know, sort of an uncharitable view [laughs]. i think it makes sense to believe in god, but exactly what decision in your life you make differently because of it, i don't know.""

gates purchased the codex leicester, a collection of scientific writings by leonardo da vinci, for us$30.8â million at an auction in 1994. gates is an avid reader, and the ceiling of his large home library is engraved with a quotation from ""the great gatsby"". he also enjoys playing bridge, tennis, and golf.

in 1999, his wealth briefly surpassed us$101â billion. despite his wealth and extensive business travel, gates usually flew coach in commercial aircraft until 1997, when he bought a private jet. since 2000, the nominal value of his microsoft holdings has declined due to a fall in microsoft's stock price after the dot-com bubble burst and the multibillion-dollar donations he has made to his charitable foundations. in a may 2006 interview, gates commented that he wished that he were not the richest man in the world because he disliked the attention it brought. in march 2010, gates was the second wealthiest person behind carlos slim, but regained the top position in 2013, according to the bloomberg billionaires list. slim retook the position again in june 2014 (but then lost the top position back to gates). between 2009 and 2014, his wealth doubled from us$40â billion to more than us$82â billion. since october 2017, gates was surpassed by amazon.com founder jeff bezos as the richest person in the world.

gates has held the top spot on the list of ""the world's billionaires"" for 18 out of the past 23 years. gates has several investments outside microsoft, which in 2006 paid him a salary of us$616,667 and us$350,000 bonus totalling us$966,667. in 1989, he founded corbis, a digital imaging company. in 2004, he became a director of berkshire hathaway, the investment company headed by long-time friend warren buffett. in 2016, he was discussing his gaming habits when he revealed that he was color-blind.

in a bbc interview, gates claimed, ""i've paid more tax than any individual ever, and gladly soâ ... i've paid over $6 billion in taxes."" he is a proponent of higher taxes, particularly for the rich. gates' days are planned for him on a minute-by-minute basis, similar to the u.s. president's schedule.


gates has written two books:



gates was the guest on bbc radio 4's ""desert island discs"" on january 31, 2016, in which he talks about his relationships with his father and steve jobs, meeting melinda ann french, the start of microsoft and some of his habits (for example reading the economist ""from cover to cover every week""). his choice of things to take on a desert island were, for music: ""blue skies"" by willie nelson; book: ""the better angels of our nature"" by steven pinker; and luxury item: a dvd collection of lectures from the teaching company.

gates made a guest appearance as himself on the emmy award winning tv show, ""the big bang theory"". the episode on which he appeared was appropriately entitled, ""the gates excitation.""
"
alan greenspan,"
alan greenspan (; born march 6, 1926) is an american economist who served as chair of the federal reserve of the united states from 1987 to 2006. he currently works as a private adviser and provides consulting for firms through his company, greenspan associates llc. first appointed federal reserve chairman by president ronald reagan in august 1987, he was reappointed at successive four-year intervals until retiring on january 31, 2006, after the second-longest tenure in the position (behind william mcchesney martin).

greenspan came to the federal reserve board from a consulting career. although he was subdued in his public appearances, favorable media coverage raised his profile to a point that several observers likened him to a ""rock star"". democratic leaders of congress criticized him for politicizing his office because of his support for social security privatization and tax cuts, which they felt would increase the deficit.

the easy-money policies of the fed during greenspan's tenure have been suggested by some to be a leading cause of the dotcom bubble, and the subprime mortgage crisis (occurring within a year of his leaving the fed), which, said the ""wall street journal"", ""tarnished his reputation."" yale economist robert shiller argues that ""once stocks fell, real estate became the primary outlet for the speculative frenzy that the stock market had unleashed"". greenspan argues that the housing bubble was not a product of low-interest rates but rather a worldwide phenomenon caused by the precipitous decline in long term interest rates.

greenspan was born in the washington heights area of new york city. his father, herbert greenspan, was of romanian jewish descent, and his mother, rose goldsmith, was of hungarian jewish descent. they were divorced. alan grew up with his mother in the household of his maternal grandparents who were born in russia. his father worked as a stockbroker and market analyst in new york city.

greenspan attended george washington high school from 1940 until he graduated in june 1943, where one of his classmates was john kemeny. he played clarinet and saxophone along with stan getz. he further studied clarinet at the juilliard school from 1943 to 1944. among his bandmates in the woody herman band was leonard garment, richard nixon's special counsel. in 1945, greenspan attended new york university's stern school of business, where he earned a b.a. degree in economics ""summa cum laude"" in 1948 and an m.a. degree in economics in 1950. at columbia university, he pursued advanced economic studies under arthur burns but dropped out.

in 1977, greenspan obtained a ph.d. in economics from new york university. his dissertation is not available from the university since it was removed at greenspan's request in 1987, when he became chairman of the federal reserve board. in april 2008, however, ""barron's"" obtained a copy and notes that it includes ""a discussion of soaring housing prices and their effect on consumer spending; it even anticipates a bursting housing bubble"".

during his economics studies at new york university, greenspan worked under eugene banks, a managing director at the wall street investment bank brown brothers harriman, in the firm's equity research department. from 1948 to 1953, greenspan worked as an analyst at the national industrial conference board (currently known as the conference board), a business- and industry-oriented think tank in new york city. from 1955 to 1987, when he was appointed chairman of the federal reserve, greenspan was chairman and president of townsend-greenspan & co., inc., an economics consulting firm in new york city, a 32-year stint interrupted only from 1974 to 1977 by his service as chairman of the council of economic advisers under president gerald ford.

in mid-1968, greenspan agreed to serve richard nixon as his coordinator on domestic policy in the nomination campaign. greenspan has also served as a corporate director for aluminum company of america (alcoa); automatic data processing; capital cities/abc, inc.; general foods; j.p. morgan & co.; morgan guaranty trust company; mobil corporation; and the pittston company. he was a director of the council on foreign relations foreign policy organization between 1982 and 1988. he also served as a member of the influential washington-based financial advisory body, the group of thirty in 1984.

on june 2, 1987, president ronald reagan nominated greenspan as a successor to paul volcker as chairman of the board of governors of the federal reserve, and the senate confirmed him on august 11, 1987. investor, author and commentator jim rogers has said that greenspan lobbied to get this chairmanship.

two months after his confirmation greenspan said immediately following the 1987 stock market crash that the fed ""affirmed today its readiness to serve as a source of liquidity to support the economic and financial system"" george h.â w. bush blamed fed policy for not winning a second term. democratic president bill clinton reappointed greenspan, and consulted him on economic matters. greenspan lent support to clinton's 1993 deficit reduction program. greenspan was fundamentally monetarist in orientation on the economy, and his monetary policy decisions largely followed standard taylor rule prescriptions (see taylor 1993 and 1999). greenspan also played a key role in organizing the u.s. bailout of mexico during the 1994â95 mexican peso crisis.

in 2000, greenspan raised interest rates several times; these actions were believed by many to have caused the bursting of the dot-com bubble. according to nobel laureate paul krugman, however, ""he didn't raise interest rates to curb the market's enthusiasm; he didn't even seek to impose margin requirements on stock market investors. instead, he waited until the bubble burst, as it did in 2000, then tried to clean up the mess afterward"". e. ray canterbery agrees with krugman's criticism.

in january 2001, greenspan, in support of president bush's proposed tax decrease, stated that the federal surplus could accommodate a significant tax cut while paying down the national debt.

in autumn 2001, as a decisive reaction to the september 11 attacks and various corporate scandals which undermined the economy, the greenspan-led federal reserve initiated a series of interest cuts that brought down the federal funds rate to 1% in 2004. while presenting the federal reserve's monetary policy report in july 2002, he said that ""it is not that humans have become any more greedy than in generations past. it is that the avenues to express greed had grown so enormously,"" and suggested that financial markets need to be more regulated. his critics, led by steve forbes, attributed the rapid rise in commodity prices and gold to greenspan's loose monetary policy, which forbes believed had caused excessive asset inflation and a weak dollar. by late 2004, the price of gold was higher than its 12-year moving average.

greenspan advised senior members of the george w. bush administration to depose saddam hussein for the sake of the oil markets. he believed that even a moderate disruption to the flow of oil could translate into high oil prices which could lead to ""chaos"" in the global economy and bring the industrial world ""to its knees"". he feared that saddam could seize control of the straits of hormuz and restrict the transport of oil through them. in a 2007 interview, he said, ""people do not realize in this country, for example, how tenuous our ties to international energy are. that is, we on a daily basis require continuous flow. if that flow is shut off, it causes catastrophic effects in the industrial world. and it's that which made him [saddam] far more important to get out than bin laden.""

on may 18, 2004, greenspan was nominated by president george w. bush to serve for an unprecedented fifth term as chairman of the federal reserve. he was previously appointed to the post by presidents reagan, george h.â w. bush, and clinton.

in a may 2005 speech, greenspan stated: ""two years ago at this conference i argued that the growing array of derivatives and the related application of more-sophisticated methods for measuring and managing risks had been key factors underlying the remarkable resilience of the banking system, which had recently shrugged off severe shocks to the economy and the financial system. at the same time, i indicated some concerns about the risks associated with derivatives, including the risks posed by concentration in certain derivatives markets, notably the over-the-counter (otc) markets for u.s. dollar interest rate options.""

greenspan opposed tariffs against people's republic of china for its refusal to let the yuan rise, suggesting instead that any american workers displaced by chinese trade could be compensated through unemployment insurance and retraining programs.

greenspan's term as a member of the board ended on january 31, 2006, and ben bernanke was confirmed as his successor.

as chairman of the board, greenspan did not give any broadcast interviews from 1987 through 2005.

immediately after leaving the fed, greenspan formed an economic consulting firm, greenspan associates llc. he also accepted an honorary (unpaid) position at hm treasury in the united kingdom.

on february 26, 2007, greenspan forecast a possible recession in the united states before or in early 2008. stabilizing corporate profits are said to have influenced his comments. the following day, the dow jones industrial average decreased by 416 points, losing 3.3% of its value.

in may 2007, greenspan was hired as a special consultant by pacific investment management company (pimco) to participate in their quarterly economic forums and speak privately with the bond managers about fed interest rate policy.

in august 2007, deutsche bank announced that it would be retaining greenspan as a senior advisor to its investment banking team and clients.

in mid-january 2008, hedge fund paulson & co. hired greenspan as an adviser. according to the terms of their agreement he was not to advise any other hedge fund while working for paulson. (in 2007 paulson had foreseen the collapse of the sub-prime housing market and hired goldman sachs to package their sub-prime holdings into derivatives and sell them. some economic commentators blamed this collapse on greenspan's policies while at the fed.)

on april 30, 2009, greenspan offered a defense of the h-1b visa program, telling a u.s. senate subcommittee that the visa quota is ""far too small to meet the need"" and saying that it protects u.s. workers from global competition, creating a ""privileged elite"". testifying on immigration reform before the subcommittee on immigration, border security and citizenship, he said more skilled immigration was needed ""as the economy copes with the forthcoming retirement wave of skilled baby boomers"".

greenspan wrote a memoir titled ""the age of turbulence: adventures in a new world"", published september 17, 2007. greenspan says that he wrote this book in longhand mostly while soaking in the bathtub, a habit he regularly employs ever since an accident in 1971, when he injured his back. greenspan wrote:

to this day, the bathtub is where i get many of my best ideas. my assistants have gotten used to typing from drafts scrawled on damp yellow padsâa chore that got much easier once we found a kind of pen whose ink doesn't run. immersed in my bath, i'm as happy as archimedes as i contemplate the world.

greenspan discusses in his book, among other things, his history in government and economics, capitalism and other economic systems, current issues in the global economy, and future issues that face the global economy. in the book greenspan criticizes president george w. bush, vice president dick cheney, and the republican-controlled congress for abandoning the republican party's principles on spending and deficits. greenspan's criticisms of president bush include his refusal to veto spending bills, sending the country into increasingly deep deficits, and for ""putting political imperatives ahead of sound economic policies"". greenspan writes, ""they swapped principle for power. they ended up with neither. they deserved to lose [the 2006 election]"". he praised bill clinton above all the other presidents for whom he'd worked for his ""consistent, disciplined focus on long-term economic growth"". although he respected what he saw as richard nixon's immense intelligence, greenspan found him to be ""sadly paranoid, misanthropic and cynical"". he said of gerald ford that he ""was as close to normal as you get in a president, but he was never elected"". regarding future u.s. economic policy, greenspan recommends improving the u.s. primary and secondary education systems. he asserts this would narrow the inequality between the minority of high-income earners and most workers whose wages have not grown in proportion with globalization and the nation's gdp growth.

in the early 1950s, greenspan began an association with novelist and philosopher ayn rand. greenspan was introduced to rand by his first wife, joan mitchell. rand nicknamed greenspan ""the undertaker"" because of his penchant for dark clothing and reserved demeanor. although greenspan was initially a logical positivist, he was converted to rand's philosophy of objectivism by her associate nathaniel branden. he became one of the members of rand's inner circle, the ayn rand collective, who read ""atlas shrugged"" while it was being written. during the 1950s and 1960s greenspan was a proponent of objectivism, writing articles for objectivist newsletters and contributing several essays for rand's 1966 book """" including an essay supporting the gold standard. rand stood beside him at his 1974 swearing-in as chair of the council of economic advisers. greenspan and rand remained friends until her death in 1982.

he has come under criticism from harry binswanger, who believes his actions while at work for the federal reserve and his publicly expressed opinions on other issues show abandonment of objectivist and free market principles. when questioned in relation to this, however, he has said that in a democratic society individuals have to make compromises with each other over conflicting ideas of how money should be handled. he said he himself had to make such compromises, because he believes that ""we did extremely well"" without a central bank and with a gold standard. in a congressional hearing on october 23, 2008, greenspan admitted that his free-market ideology shunning certain regulations was flawed. when asked about free markets and rand's ideas, however, greenspan clarified his stance on ""laissez faire"" capitalism and asserted that in a democratic society there could be no better alternative. he stated that the errors that were made stemmed not from the principle, but from the application of competitive markets in ""assuming what the nature of risks would be"".

e. ray canterbery has chronicled greenspan's relationship with rand, and has concluded that the influence has had pernicious effects on greenspan's monetary policy.

in the wake of the subprime mortgage and credit crisis in 2007, greenspan stated that there was a bubble in the u.s. housing market, warning in 2007 of ""large double digit declines"" in home values ""larger than most people expect"". greenspan also noted, however, ""i really didn't get it until very late in 2005 and 2006.""

greenspan stated that the housing bubble was ""fundamentally engendered by the decline in real long-term interest rates"", though he also claims that long-term interest rates are beyond the control of central banks because ""the market value of global long-term securities is approaching $100 trillion"" and thus these and other asset markets are large enough that they ""now swamp the resources of central banks"".

after the september 11, 2001 attacks, the federal open market committee voted to reduce the federal funds rate from 3.5% to 3.0%. then, after the accounting scandals of 2002, the fed dropped the federal funds rate from then current 1.25% to 1.00%. greenspan stated that this drop in rates would have the effect of leading to a surge in home sales and refinancing, adding that ""besides sustaining the demand for new construction, mortgage markets have also been a powerful stabilizing force over the past two years of economic distress by facilitating the extraction of some of the equity that homeowners have built up over the years"".

according to some, however, greenspan's policies of adjusting interest rates to historic lows contributed to a housing bubble in the united states. the federal reserve acknowledged the connection between lower interest rates, higher home values, and the increased liquidity the higher home values bring to the overall economy: ""like other asset prices, house prices are influenced by interest rates, and in some countries, the housing market is a key channel of monetary policy transmission"".

in a february 23, 2004 speech, greenspan suggested that more homeowners should consider taking out adjustable-rate mortgages (arms) where the interest rate adjusts itself to the current interest in the market. the fed's own funds rate was at a then all-time-low of 1%. a few months after his recommendation, greenspan began raising interest rates, in a series of rate hikes that would bring the funds rate to 5.25% about two years later. a triggering factor in the 2007 subprime mortgage financial crisis is believed to be the many subprime arms that reset at much higher interest rates than what the borrower paid during the first few years of the mortgage.

in 2008, greenspan expressed great frustration that the february 23 speech was used to criticize him on arms and the subprime mortgage crisis, and stated that he had made countervailing comments eight days after it that praised traditional fixed-rate mortgages. in that speech, greenspan had suggested that lenders should offer to home purchasers a greater variety of ""mortgage product alternatives"" other than traditional fixed-rate mortgages. greenspan also praised the rise of the subprime mortgage industry and its tools for assessing credit-worthiness:
the subprime mortgage industry collapsed in march 2007, with many of the largest lenders filing for bankruptcy protection in the face of spiraling foreclosure rates. for these reasons, greenspan has been criticized for his role in the rise of the housing bubble and the subsequent problems in the mortgage industry, as well as ""engineering"" the housing bubble itself.

in 2004 businessweek magazine analysts argued: ""it was the federal reserve-engineered decline in rates that inflated the housing bubble...the most troublesome aspect of the price runup is that many recent buyers are squeezing into houses that they can barely afford by taking advantage of the lower rates available from adjustable-rate mortgages. that leaves them fully exposed to rising rates.

in september 2008 joseph stiglitz stated that greenspan ""didn't really believe in regulation; when the excesses of the financial system were noted, (he and others) called for self-regulationâan oxymoron"". greenspan, according to ""the new york times"", says he himself is blameless. on april 6, 2005, greenspan called for a substantial increase in the regulation of fannie mae and freddie mac: ""appearing before the senate banking committee, the fed chairman, alan greenspan, said the enormous portfolios of the companiesânearly a quarter of the home-mortgage marketâposed significant risks to the nation's financial system should either company face significant problems."" despite this, greenspan still claims to be a firm believer in free markets, although in his 2007 biography he wrote, ""history has not dealt kindly with the aftermath of protracted periods of low risk premiums"" as seen before the credit crisis of 2008.

in 2009 robert reich wrote that ""greenspan's worst move was to contribute to the giant housing bubble and the worst worldwide crash since the great depression. in 2004 he lowered interest rates to 1%, enabling banks to borrow money for free, adjusted for inflation. naturally, the banks wanted to borrow as much as they possibly could, then lend it out, earning nice profits. the situation screamed for government oversight of lending institutions, lest the banks lend to unfit borrowers. he refused, trusting the market to weed out bad credit risks. it did not.""

in congressional testimony on october 23, 2008, greenspan finally conceded error on regulation. ""the new york times"" wrote, ""a humbled mr. greenspan admitted that he had put too much faith in the self-correcting power of free markets and had failed to anticipate the self-destructive power of wanton mortgage lending...mr. greenspan refused to accept blame for the crisis but acknowledged that his belief in deregulation had been shaken"". although many republican lawmakers tried to blame the housing bubble on fannie mae and freddie mac, greenspan placed far more blame on wall street for bundling subprime mortgages into securities.

in march 2008, greenspan wrote an article for the ""financial times""' economists' forum in which he said that the 2008-financial crisis in the united states is likely to be judged as the most wrenching since the end of world warâ ii. in it he argued: ""we will never be able to anticipate all discontinuities in financial markets."" he concluded: ""it is important, indeed crucial, that any reforms in, and adjustments to, the structure of markets and regulation not inhibit our most reliable and effective safeguards against cumulative economic failure: market flexibility and open competition."" the article attracted a number of critical responses from forum contributors, who, finding causation between greenspan's policies and the discontinuities in financial markets that followed, criticized greenspan mainly for what many believed to be his unbalanced and immovable ideological suppositions about global capitalism and free competitive markets. notable critics included j.â bradford delong, paul krugman, alice rivlin, michael hudson, and willem buiter.

greenspan responded to his critics in a follow-up article in which he defended his ideology as applied to his conceptual and policy framework, which, among other things, prohibited him from exerting real pressure against the burgeoning housing bubble or, in his words, ""leaning against the wind"". greenspan argued, ""my view of the range of dispersion of outcomes has been shaken, but not my judgment that free competitive markets are by far the unrivaled way to organize economies"". he concluded: ""we have tried regulation ranging from heavy to central planning. none meaningfully worked. do we wish to retest the evidence?"" ""financial times"" associate editor and chief economics commentator martin wolf defended greenspan primarily as a scapegoat for the market turmoil. several notable contributors in defense of greenspan included stephen s. roach, allan meltzer, and robert brusca.

however, an october 15, 2008, article in ""the washington post"" analyzing the origins of the economic crisis claims that greenspan vehemently opposed any regulation of derivatives, and actively sought to undermine the office of the commodity futures trading commission when the commission sought to initiate regulation of derivatives. meanwhile, greenspan recommended improving mark-to-market regulations to avoid having derivatives or other complex assets marked to a distressed or illiquid market during times of material adverse conditions seen during the late 2000s credit crisis.

greenspan was not alone in his opposition to derivatives regulation. in a 1999 government report that was a key driver in the passage of the commodity futures modernization act of 2000âlegislation that clarified that most over-the-counter derivatives were outside the regulatory authority of any government agencyâgreenspan was joined by treasury secretary lawrence summers, securities and exchange commission chairman arthur levitt, and commodity futures trading commission chairman william ranier in concluding that ""under many circumstances, the trading of financial derivatives by eligible swap participants should be excluded from the cea"" (commodity exchange act). other government agencies also supported that view.

in congressional testimony on october 23, 2008, greenspan acknowledged that he was ""partially"" wrong in opposing regulation and stated ""those of us who have looked to the self-interest of lending institutions to protect shareholder's equityâmyself especiallyâare in a state of shocked disbelief."" referring to his free-market ideology, greenspan said: ""i have found a flaw. i don't know how significant or permanent it is. but i have been very distressed by that fact."" when representative henry waxman (d-ca) pressed him to clarify his words. ""in other words, you found that your view of the world, your ideology, was not right, it was not working,"" waxman said. ""absolutely, precisely,"" greenspan replied. ""you know, that's precisely the reason i was shocked, because i have been going for 40 years or more with very considerable evidence that it was working exceptionally well."" greenspan admitted fault in opposing regulation of derivatives and acknowledged that financial institutions didn't protect shareholders and investments as well as he expected.

matt taibbi described the greenspan put and its bad consequences saying: ""every time the banks blew up a speculative bubble, they could go back to the fed and borrow money at zero or one or two percent, and then start the game all over"", thereby making it ""almost impossible"" for the banks to lose money. he also called greenspan a ""classic con man"" who, through political savvy, ""flattered and bullshitted his way up the matterhorn of american power and...jacked himself off to the attention of wall street for 20 consecutive years"".

in the documentary film ""inside job"", greenspan is cited as one of the persons responsible for the financial crisis of 2007â08. he is also named in ""time magazine"" as one of the ""25 people to blame for the financial crisis"".

greenspan describes himself as a ""lifelong libertarian republican"".

in march 2005, in reaction to greenspan's support of president bush's plan to partially privatize social security, then-democratic senate minority leader harry reid attacked greenspan as ""one of the biggest political hacks we have in washington"" and criticized him for supporting bush's 2001 tax cut plan. then-democratic house minority leader nancy pelosi added that there were serious questions about the fed's independence as a result of greenspan's public statements. greenspan also received criticism from democratic congressman barney frank and others for supporting bush's social security plans favoring private accounts. greenspan had said bush's model has ""the seeds of developing full funding by its very nature. as i've said before, i've always supported moves to full funding in the context of a private account"".

others, like republican senator mitch mcconnell, disagreed that greenspan was too deferential to bush, stating that greenspan ""has been an independent player at the fed for a long time under both parties and made an enormous positive contribution"".

economist paul krugman wrote that greenspan was a ""three-card maestro"" with a ""lack of sincerity"" who, ""by repeatedly shilling for whatever the bush administration wants, has betrayed the trust placed in the fed chairman"".

republican senator jim bunning, who opposed greenspan's fifth reconfirmation, charged that greenspan should comment only on monetary policy, not fiscal policy. greenspan had used his position as fed chairman to comment upon fiscal policy as early as 1993, however, when he supported president clinton's deficit reduction plan, which included tax increases and budget cuts.

in an october 2011 lecture addressing the occupy movement, noam chomsky characterized portions of greenspan's february 1997 testimony to the u.s. senate as an example of the self-serving attitudes of the so-called 1%. in that testimony, greenspan had stated that growing worker insecurity is a significant factor keeping inflation and inflation expectation low, thereby promoting long-term investment.

greenspan has married twice. his first marriage was to a canadian artist named joan mitchell in 1952; the marriage ended in annulment less than a year later. he dated newswoman barbara walters in the late 1970s. in 1984, greenspan began dating journalist andrea mitchell. greenspan at the time was 58; mitchell is 20 years younger. in 1997, they were married by supreme court justice ruth bader ginsburg.


in 1976, greenspan received the u.s. senator john heinz award for greatest public service by an elected or appointed official, an award given out annually by jefferson awards.

in 1989 he was elected as a fellow of the american statistical association.

in 2004, greenspan received the dwight d. eisenhower medal for leadership and service, from eisenhower fellowships. in 2005, he became the first recipient of the harry s. truman medal for economic policy, presented by the harry s. truman library institute. in 2007, greenspan was the recipient of the inaugural thomas jefferson foundation medal in citizen leadership, presented by the university of virginia.

on december 14, 2005, he was awarded an honorary doctor of commercial science degree by new york university, his fourth degree from that institution. on april 19, 2012, greenspan received the eugene j. keogh award for distinguished public service from nyu.
"
dmitri mendeleev,"
dmitri ivanovich mendeleev (often romanized as mendeleyev or mendeleef) ( ; , <nowiki>,</nowiki> ; 8 february 18342 february 1907 ) was a russian chemist and inventor. he formulated the periodic law, created a farsighted version of the periodic table of elements, and used it to correct the properties of some already discovered elements and also to predict the properties of eight elements yet to be discovered.

mendeleev was born in the village of verkhnie aremzyani, near tobolsk in siberia, to ivan pavlovich mendeleev (1783â1847) and maria dmitrievna mendeleeva (nã©e kornilieva) (1793â1850). his paternal grandfather pavel maximovich sokolov was a russian orthodox priest from the tver region. ivan, along with his brothers and sisters, obtained new family names while attending the theological seminary. he worked as a school principal and a teacher of fine arts, politics and philosophy at the tambov and saratov gymnasiums.

maria kornilieva came from a well-known dynasty of tobolsk merchants, founders of the first siberian printing house who traced their ancestry to yakov korniliev, a 17th-century posad man turned a wealthy merchant. in 1889 a local librarian published an article in the tobolsk newspaper where he claimed that yakov was a baptized teleut, an ethnic minority known as ""white kalmyks"" at the time. since no sources were provided and no documented facts of yakov's life were ever revealed, biographers generally dismiss it as a myth. in 1908, shortly after mendeleev's death, one of his nieces published ""family chronicles. memories about d. i. mendeleev"" where she voiced ""a family legend"" about maria's grandfather who married ""a kyrgyz or tatar beauty whom he loved so much that when she died, he also died from grief"". this, however, contradicts the documented family chronicles, and neither of those legends is supported by mendeleev's autobiography, his daughter's or his wife's memoirs. yet some western scholars still refer to mendeleev's supposed ""mongol"", ""tatar"", ""tartarian"" or simply ""asian"" ancestry as a fact.

mendeleev was raised as an orthodox christian, his mother encouraging him to ""patiently search divine and scientific truth"". his son would later inform that he departed from the church and embraced a form of ""romanticized deism"".

mendeleev was the youngest of 17 siblings, of whom ""only 14 stayed alive to be baptized"" according to mendeleev's brother pavel, meaning the others died soon after their birth. the exact number of mendeleev's siblings differs among sources and is still a matter of some historical dispute. unfortunately for the family's financial well being, his father became blind and lost his teaching position. his mother was forced to work and she restarted her family's abandoned glass factory. at the age ofâ 13, after the passing of his father and the destruction of his mother's factory by fire, mendeleev attended the gymnasium in tobolsk.

in 1849, his mother took mendeleev across russia from siberia to moscow with the aim of getting mendeleev a higher education. the university in moscow did not accept him. the mother and son continued to saint petersburg to the father's alma mater. the now poor mendeleev family relocated to saint petersburg, where he entered the main pedagogical institute in 1850. after graduation, he contracted tuberculosis, causing him to move to the crimean peninsula on the northern coast of the black sea in 1855. while there, he became a science master of the 1st simferopol gymnasium. in 1857, he returned to saint petersburg with fully restored health.

between 1859 and 1861, he worked on the capillarity of liquids and the workings of the spectroscope in heidelberg. later in 1861, he published a textbook named ""organic chemistry"". this won him the demidov prize of the petersburg academy of sciences.

on 4â april 1862 he became engaged to feozva nikitichna leshcheva, and they married on 27â april 1862 at nikolaev engineering institute's church in saint petersburg (where he taught).

mendeleev became a professor at the saint petersburg technological institute and saint petersburg state university in 1864, and 1865, respectively. in 1865 he became doctor of science for his dissertation ""on the combinations of water with alcohol"". he achieved tenure in 1867 at st. petersburg university and started to teach inorganic chemistry, while succeeding voskresenskii to this post. and by 1871 he had transformed saint petersburg into an internationally recognized center for chemistry research.

in 1863, there were 56 known elements with a new element being discovered at a rate of approximately one per year. other scientists had previously identified periodicity of elements. john newlands described a law of octaves, noting their periodicity according to relative atomic weight in 1864, publishing it in 1865. his proposal identified the potential for new elements such as germanium. the concept was criticized and his innovation was not recognized by the society of chemists until 1887. another person to propose a periodic table was lothar meyer, who published a paper in 1864 describing 28 elements classified by their valence, but with no predictions of new elements.

after becoming a teacher in 1867, mendeleev wrote the definitive textbook of his time: ""principles of chemistry"" (two volumes, 1868â1870). it was written as he was preparing a textbook for his course. this is when he made his most important discovery. as he attempted to classify the elements according to their chemical properties, he noticed patterns that led him to postulate his periodic table; he claimed to have envisioned the complete arrangement of the elements in a dream:

unaware of the earlier work on periodic tables going on in the 1860s, he made the following table:
by adding additional elements following this pattern, mendeleev developed his extended version of the periodic table. on 6 march 1869, he made a formal presentation to the russian chemical society, titled ""the dependence between the properties of the atomic weights of the elements"", which described elements according to both atomic weight (now called ""relative atomic mass"") and valence. this presentation stated that

mendeleev published his periodic table of all known elements and predicted several new elements to complete the table in a russian-language journal. only a few months after, meyer published a virtually identical table in a german-language journal. mendeleev has the distinction of accurately predicting the qualities of what he called ekasilicon, ekaaluminium and ekaboron (germanium, gallium and scandium, respectively).

for his predicted eight elements, he used the prefixes of eka, dvi, and tri (sanskrit one, two, three) in their naming. mendeleev questioned some of the currently accepted atomic weights (they could be measured only with a relatively low accuracy at that time), pointing out that they did not correspond to those suggested by his periodic law. he noted that tellurium has a higher atomic weight than iodine, but he placed them in the right order, incorrectly predicting that the accepted atomic weights at the time were at fault. he was puzzled about where to put the known lanthanides, and predicted the existence of another row to the table which were the actinides which were some of the heaviest in atomic weight. some people dismissed mendeleev for predicting that there would be more elements, but he was proven to be correct when ga (gallium) and ge (germanium) were found in 1875 and 1886 respectively, fitting perfectly into the two missing spaces.

by using sanskrit prefixes to name ""missing"" elements, mendeleev may have recorded his debt to the sanskrit grammarians of ancient india, who had created sophisticated theories of language based on their discovery of the two-dimensional patterns of speech sounds (arguably most strikingly exemplified by the åivaså«tras in päá¹ini's sanskrit grammar). mendeleev was a friend and colleague of the sanskritist otto von bã¶htlingk, who was preparing the second edition of his book on päá¹ini at about this time, and mendeleev wished to honor päá¹ini with his nomenclature.

the original draft made by mendeleev would be found years later and published under the name ""tentative system of elements.""

dmitri mendeleev is often referred to as the father of the periodic table. he called his table or matrix, ""the periodic system"".

in 1876, he became obsessed with anna ivanova popova and began courting her; in 1881 he proposed to her and threatened suicide if she refused. his divorce from leshcheva was finalized one month after he had married popova (on 2â april) in early 1882. even after the divorce, mendeleev was technically a bigamist; the russian orthodox church required at least seven years before lawful remarriage. his divorce and the surrounding controversy contributed to his failure to be admitted to the russian academy of sciences (despite his international fame by that time). his daughter from his second marriage, lyubov, became the wife of the famous russian poet alexander blok. his other children were son vladimir (a sailor, he took part in the notable eastern journey of nicholasâ ii) and daughter olga, from his first marriage to feozva, and son ivan and twins from anna.

though mendeleev was widely honored by scientific organizations all over europe, including (in 1882) the davy medal from the royal society of london (which later also awarded him the copley medal in 1905), he resigned from saint petersburg university on 17â august 1890. he was elected a foreign member of the royal society (formemrs) in 1892, and in 1893 he was appointed director of the bureau of weights and measures, a post which he occupied until his death.

mendeleev also investigated the composition of petroleum, and helped to found the first oil refinery in russia. he recognized the importance of petroleum as a feedstock for petrochemicals. he is credited with a remark that burning petroleum as a fuel ""would be akin to firing up a kitchen stove with bank notes"".
in 1905, mendeleev was elected a member of the royal swedish academy of sciences. the following year the nobel committee for chemistry recommended to the swedish academy to award the nobel prize in chemistry for 1906 to mendeleev for his discovery of the periodic system. the chemistry section of the swedish academy supported this recommendation. the academy was then supposed to approve the committee's choice, as it has done in almost every case. unexpectedly, at the full meeting of the academy, a dissenting member of the nobel committee, peter klason, proposed the candidacy of henri moissan whom he favored. svante arrhenius, although not a member of the nobel committee for chemistry, had a great deal of influence in the academy and also pressed for the rejection of mendeleev, arguing that the periodic system was too old to acknowledge its discovery in 1906. according to the contemporaries, arrhenius was motivated by the grudge he held against mendeleev for his critique of arrhenius's dissociation theory. after heated arguments, the majority of the academy chose moissan by a margin of one vote. the attempts to nominate mendeleev in 1907 were again frustrated by the absolute opposition of arrhenius.

in 1907, mendeleev died at the age of 72 in saint petersburg from influenza. his last words were to his physician: ""doctor, you have science, i have faith,"" which is possibly a jules verne quote.

mendeleev made other important contributions to chemistry. the russian chemist and science historian lev chugaev has characterized him as ""a chemist of genius, first-class physicist, a fruitful researcher in the fields of hydrodynamics, meteorology, geology, certain branches of chemical technology (explosives, petroleum, and fuels, for example) and other disciplines adjacent to chemistry and physics, a thorough expert of chemical industry and industry in general, and an original thinker in the field of economy."" mendeleev was one of the founders, in 1869, of the russian chemical society. he worked on the theory and practice of protectionist trade and on agriculture.

in an attempt at a chemical conception of the aether, he put forward a hypothesis that there existed two inert chemical elements of lesser atomic weight than hydrogen. of these two proposed elements, he thought the lighter to be an all-penetrating, all-pervasive gas, and the slightly heavier one to be a proposed element, ""coronium"".

mendeleev devoted much study and made important contributions to the determination of the nature of such indefinite compounds as solutions.
in another department of physical chemistry, he investigated the expansion of liquids with heat, and devised a formula similar to gay-lussac's law of the uniformity of the expansion of gases, while in 1861 he anticipated thomas andrews' conception of the critical temperature of gases by defining the absolute boiling-point of a substance as the temperature at which cohesion and heat of vaporization become equal to zero and the liquid changes to vapor, irrespective of the pressure and volume.

mendeleev is given credit for the introduction of the metric system to the russian empire.

he invented ""pyrocollodion"", a kind of smokeless powder based on nitrocellulose. this work had been commissioned by the russian navy, which however did not adopt its use. in 1892 mendeleev organized its manufacture.

mendeleev studied petroleum origin and concluded hydrocarbons are abiogenic and form deep within the earth â see abiogenic petroleum origin.
he wrote: ""the capital fact to note is that petroleum was born in the depths of the earth, and it is only there that we must seek its origin."" (dmitri mendeleev, 1877)

beginning in the 1870s, he published widely beyond chemistry, looking at aspects of russian industry, and technical issues in agricultural productivity. he explored demographic issues, sponsored studies of the arctic sea, tried to measure the value of chemical fertilizers, and promoted the a merchant navy. he was especially active in promoting the russian petroleum industry, making careful detail comparisons with the more advanced industry in pennsylvania. he joined in the debate about the scientific claims of spiritualism, arguing that metaphysical idealism was no more than ignorant superstition. he bemoaned the widespread acceptance of spiritualism in russian culture, and its negative effects on the study of science. although he was not well grounded in economic theory, he helped convince the ministry of finance in 1887-1891 to impose a temporary tariff in 1891 which, based on his wide travels in europe, suggested it would allow russian industry to mature faster. after resigning his professorship at at st. petersburg university following a dispute with officials at the ministry of education in 1907, he became director of russia's central bureau of weights and measures, he led the way to standardize fundamental prototypes and measurement procedures. he set up an inspection system, and introduced the metric system to russia.

a very popular russian story is that it was mendeleev who came up with the 40% standard strength of vodka in 1894, after having been appointed director of the bureau of weights and measures with the assignment to formulate new state standards for the production of vodka. this story has, for instance, been used in marketing claims by the russian standard vodka brand that ""in 1894, dmitri mendeleev, the greatest scientist in all russia, received the decree to set the imperial quality standard for russian vodka and the 'russian standard' was born"", or that the vodka is ""compliant with the highest quality of russian vodka approved by the royal government commission headed by mendeleev in 1894"".

while it is true that mendeleev in 1892 became head of the archive of weights and measures in saint petersburg, and evolved it into a government bureau the following year, that institution was never involved in setting any production quality standards, but was issued with standardising russian trade weights and measuring instruments. furthermore, the 40% standard strength was already introduced by the russian government in 1843, when mendeleev was nine years old.

the basis for the whole story is a popular myth that mendeleev's 1865 doctoral dissertation ""a discourse on the combination of alcohol and water"" contained a statement that 38% is the ideal strength of vodka, and that this number was later rounded to 40% to simplify the calculation of alcohol tax. however, mendeleev's dissertation was about alcohol concentrations over 70% and he never wrote anything about vodka.

a number of places and objects are associated with the name and achievements of the scientist.

in saint petersburg his name was given to d. i. mendeleev institute for metrology, the national metrology institute, dealing with establishing and supporting national and worldwide standards for precise measurements. next to it there is a monument to him that consists of his sitting statue and a depiction of his periodic table on the wall of the establishment.

in the twelve collegia building, now being the centre of saint petersburg state university and in mendeleev's time â head pedagogical institute â there is dmitry mendeleev's memorial museum apartment with his archives. the street in front of these is named after him as mendeleevskaya liniya (mendeleev line).

in moscow, there is the d. mendeleyev university of chemical technology of russia.

after him was also named mendelevium, which is a synthetic chemical element with the symbol md (formerly mv) and the atomic number 101. it is a metallic radioactive transuranic element in the actinide series, usually synthesized by bombarding einsteinium with alpha particles.

the mineral mendeleevite-ce, cs(ceca)(sio)(oh,f)(ho), was named in mendeleev's honor in 2010. the related species mendeleevite-nd, cs[(nd,ree)ca](sio)(oh,f)(ho), was described in 2015.

a large lunar impact crater mendeleev, that is located on the far side of the moon, also bears the name of the scientist.

the russian academy of sciences has occasionally awarded a mendeleev golden medal since 1965.

gal gadot,"
gal gadot varsano (, ; born 30 april 1985) is an israeli actress and model. at age 18, she was crowned miss israel 2004. she then served two years in the israel defense forces as a combat instructor, and she began studying law and international relations at idc herzliya college while building up her modeling and acting careers.

gadot's first international film role came as gisele yashar in ""fast & furious"" (2009), a role she reprised in subsequent installments of the film franchise. she went on to earn worldwide fame for portraying wonder woman in the dc extended universe, beginning with """" (2016), followed by the solo film ""wonder woman"" and the ensemble ""justice league"" (both 2017). in 2018, gadot was included on ""time""s annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world, and she was listed among the highest-paid actresses in the world.

gal gadot was born in petah tikva, israel, and raised in its neighbouring city of rosh haayin. in hebrew, her first name means ""wave"" and her surname means ""riverbanks"". her parents are irit (nã©e weiss), a teacher, and michael gadot, an engineer. both her parents were born in israel, and they hebraized their surname from ""greenstein"" to ""gadot"" prior to her birth. her father is a sixth-generation sabra. her maternal grandparents were born in europe; her grandfather, who was imprisoned in the auschwitz concentration camp, survived the holocaust, and her grandmother left before the nazi invasion. gadot has stated that she was brought up in a ""very jewish, israeli family environment"". her ancestry is polish-jewish, austrian-jewish, german-jewish, and czech-jewish. she has one younger sister.

her high school major was biology. she says that in high school she was good at basketball because of her height. as a teenager, her first jobs were babysitting and working at burger king. as an adult, gadot studied law and international relations at the idc herzliya college.

gadot completed her two mandatory years of service in the israel defense forces, enlisted as a combat instructor. she said of her time in the israeli military: ""you give two or three years, and it's not about you. you learn discipline and respect."" gadot says that her background helped her to win the role of gisele in ""fast & furious"": ""i think the main reason was that the director justin lin really liked that i was in the military, and he wanted to use my knowledge of weapons.""

at age 18, gadot won the 2004 miss israel beauty pageant and next competed in the miss universe 2004 pageant in ecuador. she carried out her mandatory two-year military service from the age of 20, then studied law.

gadot has led international campaigns as a model for miss sixty, huawei smartphones, captain morgan rum, gucci fragrances and vine vera skincare ranges, and jaguar cars. in 2015, she became the face of gucci's bamboo perfume brand. she has been featured as the covergirl on ""cosmopolitan"", ""glamour"", ""bride magazine"", ""entertainment weekly"", ""umm"", ""cleo"", ""fashion"", ""lucire"", ""fhm"". gadot has been the main model for fashion brand castro in 2008â16. in 2013, her combined annual modelling and acting salary was estimated at nis 2.4â million, which was ahead of a number of other famous israeli models such as esti ginzburg and shlomit malka, though significantly behind bar refaeli.

in 2007, 21-year-old gadot was in the ""maxim"" photo shoot, ""women of the idf"", and was then featured on the cover of the ""new york post"". in april 2012, ""shalom life"" ranked her number 5 on its list of ""the 50 most talented, intelligent, funny, and gorgeous jewish women in the world"", behind model bar refaeli and actress eva green. in 2014, gadot was one of two israeli actresses, along with odeya rush, listed as an upcoming leading lady by ""instyle"" magazine.

after gadot had completed her first year of college, a casting director contacted her agent to have gadot audition for the part of bond girl camille montes in the spy film ""quantum of solace"". although the part eluded her, a few months later, gadot starred in the 2008 israeli drama ""bubot"". three months later, the casting director from her ""quantum of solace"" audition chose gadot over six other actresses for the role of gisele yashar in the action film ""fast & furious"", the fourth film in ""the fast and the furious"" franchise. gadot performed her own stuntwork in those films.

in 2010, she had small roles in the action-comedy ""date night"" and the action-adventure comedy ""knight and day"". 2011 brought her back to ""the fast and the furious"" franchise, reprising her role as gisele in ""fast five"", and in 2013's ""fast & furious 6"".

gadot portrayed wonder woman in the superhero film """" (2016). gadot received swordsmanship, kung fu, kickboxing, capoeira and brazilian jiu-jitsu training in preparation for the role. gadot's performance as the superhero, which was the character's first appearance in film, was hailed as one of the best parts of the film.

also in 2016, she had a small role in john hillcoat's crime-thriller ""triple 9"", where she starred along with kate winslet and aaron paul. later that year, she co-starred in the action crime thriller film ""criminal"", as the wife of ryan reynolds' character, alongside kevin costner, gary oldman, and tommy lee jones. her final film of 2016 was the action comedy ""keeping up with the joneses"", in which she played a secret agent, alongside zach galifianakis, jon hamm, and isla fisher.

in 2017, gadot starred in a solo film for her character, ""wonder woman"". she reprised the role in the ensemble film ""justice league"", which was released in november 2017, and was her third dc extended universe instalment. in 2017 gadot was also invited to become a member of the academy of motion picture arts and sciences. emily shire stated that gadot's acting defies some of the stereotypes of women, especially as many jewish women were portrayed on film as unattractive or the funny sidekick.

gadot provided the voice of shank in the walt disney animation studios' film ""ralph breaks the internet"".

gadot, fellow ""wonder woman"" actress lynda carter, dc entertainment president diane nelson, ""wonder woman"" director patty jenkins and u.n. under-secretary general cristina gallach appeared at the united nations on 21 october 2016, the 75th anniversary of the first appearance of wonder woman, to mark the character's designation by the united nations as its ""honorary ambassador for the empowerment of women and girls"". the gesture was intended to raise awareness of un sustainable development goal no. 5, which seeks to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls by 2030. the decision was met with protests from un staff members who stated in their petition to un secretary-general ban ki-moon that the character is ""not culturally encompassing or sensitive"" and served to objectify women. as a result, the character was stripped of the designation, and the project ended 16 december.

geoffrey hinton,"
geoffrey everest hinton (born 6 december 1947) is an english canadian cognitive psychologist and computer scientist, most noted for his work on artificial neural networks. since 2013 he divides his time working for google (google brain) and the university of toronto.

with david e. rumelhart and ronald j. williams, hinton was co-author of a highly cited paper published in 1986 that popularized the backpropagation algorithm for training multi-layer neural networks, although they were not the first to propose the approach. hinton is viewed by some as a leading figure in the deep learning community and is referred to by some as the ""godfather of deep learning"". the dramatic image-recognition milestone of the alexnet designed by his student alex krizhevsky for the imagenet challenge 2012 helped to revolutionize the field of computer vision. hinton was awarded the 2018 turing prize alongside yoshua bengio and yann lecun for their work on deep learning.

hinton was educated at king's college, cambridge graduating in 1970, with a bachelor of arts in experimental psychology. he continued his study at the university of edinburgh where he was awarded a phd in artificial intelligence in 1978 for research supervised by christopher longuet-higgins.

after his phd he worked at the university of sussex, and (after difficulty finding funding in britain) the university of california, san diego, and carnegie mellon university. he was the founding director of the gatsby charitable foundation computational neuroscience unit at university college london, and a professor in the computer science department at the university of toronto. he holds a canada research chair in machine learning, and is currently an advisor for the ""learning in machines & brains"" program at the canadian institute for advanced research. hinton taught a free online course on neural networks on the education platform coursera in 2012. hinton joined google in march 2013 when his company, dnnresearch inc., was acquired. he is planning to ""divide his time between his university research and his work at google"".

hinton's research investigates ways of using neural networks for machine learning, memory, perception and symbol processing. he has authored or co-authored over 200 peer reviewed publications.

while hinton was a professor at carnegie mellon university (1982â1987), david e. rumelhart and hinton and ronald j. williams applied the backpropagation algorithm to multi-layer neural networks. their experiments showed that such networks can learn useful internal representations of data. in an interview of 2018, hinton said that ""david e. rumelhart came up with the basic idea of backpropagation, so it's his invention."" although this work was important in popularizing backpropagation, it was not the first to suggest the approach. reverse-mode automatic differentiation, of which backpropagation is a special case, was proposed by seppo linnainmaa in 1970, and paul werbos proposed to use it to train neural networks in 1974.

during the same period, hinton co-invented boltzmann machines with david ackley and terry sejnowski. his other contributions to neural network research include distributed representations, time delay neural network, mixtures of experts, helmholtz machines and product of experts. in 2007 hinton coauthored an unsupervised learning paper titled ""unsupervised learning of image transformations"". an accessible introduction to geoffrey hinton's research can be found in his articles in ""scientific american"" in september 1992 and october 1993.""."" 

in october and november 2017 respectively, hinton published two open access research papers on the theme of capsule neural networks, which according to hinton are ""finally something that works well.""

notable former phd students and postdoctoral researchers from his group include richard zemel, brendan frey, radford m. neal, ruslan salakhutdinov, ilya sutskever, yann lecun and zoubin ghahramani.

hinton was elected a fellow of the royal society (frs) in 1998. he was the first winner of the rumelhart prize in 2001. his certificate of election for the royal society reads: 

in 2001, hinton was awarded an honorary doctorate from the university of edinburgh. he was the 2005 recipient of the ijcai award for research excellence lifetime-achievement award. he has also been awarded the 2011 herzberg canada gold medal for science and engineering. in 2013, hinton was awarded an honorary doctorate from the universitã© de sherbrooke.

in 2016, he was elected a foreign member of national academy of engineering ""for contributions to the theory and practice of artificial neural networks and their application to speech recognition and computer vision"". he also received the 2016 ieee/rse wolfson james clerk maxwell award.

he has won the bbva foundation frontiers of knowledge award (2016) in the information and communication technologies category ""for his pioneering and highly influential work"" to endow machines with the ability to learn.

together with yann lecun, and yoshua bengio, hinton won the 2018 turing award for conceptual and engineering breakthroughs that have made deep neural networks a critical component of computing.

hinton is the great-great-grandson both of logician george boole whose work eventually became one of the foundations of modern computer science, and of surgeon and author james hinton. who was the father of charles howard hinton. hinton's father was howard hinton. his middle name is from another relative, george everest. he is the nephew of the economist colin clark. he lost his first wife to ovarian cancer in 1994.

hinton moved from the u.s. to canada in part due to disillusionment with ronald reagan-era politics and disapproval of military funding of artificial intelligence.

hinton has petitioned against lethal autonomous weapons. regarding existential risk from artificial intelligence, hinton typically declines to make predictions more than five years into the future, noting that exponential progress makes the uncertainty too great. however, in an informal conversation with the ai risk researcher nick bostrom in november 2015, overheard by journalist raffi khatchadourian, he is reported to have stated that he did not expect general a.i. to be achieved for decades (âno sooner than 2070â), and that, in the context of a dichotomy earlier introduced by bostrom between people who think managing existential risk from artificial intelligence is probably hopeless versus easy enough that it will be solved automatically, hinton ""[is] in the camp that is hopeless.â he has stated, âi think political systems will use it to terrorize peopleâ and has expressed his belief that agencies like the national security agency (nsa) are already attempting to abuse similar technology.

asked by nick bostrom why he continues research despite his grave concerns, hinton stated, ""i could give you the usual arguments. but the truth is that the prospect of discovery is too ""sweet"".""

according to the same report, hinton does not categorically rule out human beings controlling an artificial superintelligence, but warns that ""there is not a good track record of less intelligent things controlling things of greater intelligence"".

sal khan,"
salman âsalâ khan (born october 11, 1976) is an american educator and mathematician who founded khan academy, a free online education platform and an organization with which he has produced over 6,500 video lessons teaching a wide spectrum of academic subjects, originally focusing on mathematics and sciences. he is also the founder of khan lab school, a brick-and-mortar school associated with khan academy.

as of june 2019, the khan academy channel on youtube has more than 4.8 million subscribers and the khan academy videos have been viewed more than 1.6 billion times. in 2012, ""time"" named salman khan in its annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world. in the same year, ""forbes"" magazine featured khan on its cover, with the story ""$1 trillion opportunity.""

salman khan was born in metairie, louisiana, united states, to a bengali family. his father was from barisal, bangladesh, and his mother was from murshidabad, india. he attended the public school grace king high school, where, as he recalls, ""a few classmates were fresh out of jail and others were bound for top universities."" he graduated valedictorian in 1994.

khan attended the massachusetts institute of technology (mit), graduating with bachelor of science and master of science degrees in course 6 (electrical engineering and computer science), and another bachelor's degree in course 18 (mathematics), in 1998. he was class president in his senior year.

khan also holds a master of business administration from harvard business school.

in 2002, khan was a summer intern at parc. from 2003 to late 2009, khan worked as a hedge fund analyst at connective capital management.<ref name=""http://chronicle.com""></ref><ref name=""http://www.linkedin.com""></ref>

in late 2003, khan began tutoring his cousin, nadia, in mathematics over the internet using yahoo!'s doodle notepad. when other relatives and friends sought his tutoring, he moved his tutorials to youtube where he created an account on november 16, 2006.

the popularity of his educational videos on the video-sharing website prompted khan to quit his job as a financial analyst in late 2009. he moved his focus to developing his youtube channel, khan academy, full time with the aid of close friend josh gefner. khan consequently received sponsorship from ann doerr, the wife of john doerr.

his videos received worldwide interest from both students and non-students, with more than 458 million views in the first number of years.

khan outlined his mission as to ""accelerate learning for students of all ages. with this in mind, we want to share our content with whoever may find it useful."" khan plans to extend the ""free school"" to cover topics such as english. khan's videos are also used to educate rural areas of africa and asia.

khan published a book about khan academy and education goals titled ""the one world schoolhouse: education reimagined.""

khan academy, initially a tool for students, added the coach feature in 2012, promoting the connection of teachers with students through videos and monitor tools.

by 2018, khan academy's videos on youtube had been viewed over 1.6 billion times.

khan believes that supplementing traditional classroom education with the technology being developed by his academy can improve the effectiveness of teachers by freeing them from traditional lectures and giving them more time for instruction specific to individual students' needs.

stanford ai researcher andrew ng has named khan as a huge inspiration for the founding of coursera, one of the first massive open online courses (moocs) platforms.

khan is married to physician umaima marvi. the couple live with their children in mountain view, california.
