abraham lincoln,"
abraham lincoln (february 12, 1809 â april 15, 1865) was an american statesman and lawyer who served as the 16th president of the united states from march 1861 until his assassination in april 1865. lincoln led the nation through the american civil war, its bloodiest war and its greatest moral, constitutional, and political crisis. he preserved the union, abolished slavery, strengthened the federal government, and modernized the u.s. economy.

born in kentucky, lincoln grew up on the frontier in a poor family. self-educated, he became a lawyer, whig party leader, illinois state legislator and congressman. in 1849, he left government to resume his law practice, but angered by the success of democrats in opening the prairie lands to slavery, reentered politics in 1854. he became a leader in the new republican party and gained national attention in 1858 for debating national democratic leader stephen a. douglas in the 1858 illinois senate campaign. he then ran for president in 1860, sweeping the north and winning. southern pro-slavery elements took his win as proof that the north was rejecting the constitutional rights of southern states to practice slavery. they began the process of seceding from the union. to secure its independence, the new confederate states of america fired on fort sumter, one of the few u.s. forts in the south. lincoln called up volunteers and militia to suppress the rebellion and restore the union.

as the leader of the moderate faction of the republican party, lincoln confronted radical republicans, who demanded harsher treatment of the south; war democrats, who rallied a large faction of former opponents into his camp; anti-war democrats (called copperheads), who despised him; and irreconcilable secessionists, who plotted his assassination. lincoln fought the factions by pitting them against each other, by carefully distributing political patronage, and by appealing to the american people. his gettysburg address became an iconic call for nationalism, republicanism, equal rights, liberty, and democracy. he suspended ""habeas corpus"", and he averted british intervention by defusing the ""trent"" affair. lincoln closely supervised the war effort, including the selection of generals and the naval blockade that shut down the south's trade. as the war progressed, he maneuvered to end slavery, issuing the emancipation proclamation of 1863; ordering the army to protect escaped slaves, encouraging border states to outlaw slavery, and pushing through congress the thirteenth amendment to the united states constitution, which outlawed slavery across the country.

lincoln managed his own re-election campaign. he sought to reconcile his damaged nation by avoiding retribution against the secessionists. a few days after the battle of appomattox court house, he was shot by john wilkes booth, an actor and confederate sympathizer, on april 14, 1865, and died the following day. abraham lincoln is remembered as the united states' martyr hero. he is consistently ranked both by scholars and the public as among the greatest u.s. presidents.

abraham lincoln was born on february 12, 1809, as the second child of thomas lincoln and nancy hanks lincoln, in a one-room log cabin on sinking spring farm near hodgenville, kentucky. he was a descendant of samuel lincoln, an englishman who migrated from hingham, norfolk, to its namesake, hingham, massachusetts, in 1638. samuel's grandson and great-grandson began the family's westward migration, passing through new jersey, pennsylvania, and virginia. lincoln's paternal grandfather and namesake, captain abraham lincoln, moved the family from virginia to jefferson county, kentucky, in the 1780s. captain lincoln was killed in an indian raid in 1786. his children, including eight-year-old thomas, abraham's father, witnessed the attack. thomas then worked at odd jobs in kentucky and in tennessee, before settling with members of his family in hardin county, kentucky, in the early 1800s.
lincoln's mother, nancy, is widely assumed to have been the daughter of lucy hanks, although no record documents this. thomas and nancy married on june 12, 1806, in washington county, and moved to elizabethtown, kentucky. they produced three children: sarah, born on february 10, 1807; abraham, on february 12, 1809; and thomas, who died in infancy.

thomas lincoln bought or leased farms in kentucky. thomas became embroiled in legal disputes, and lost all but of his land in court disputes over property titles. in 1816, the family moved to indiana, where the survey process was more reliable and land titles were more secure. indiana was a ""free"" (non-slaveholding) territory, and they settled in an ""unbroken forest"" in hurricane township, perry county. (their land became part of spencer county, indiana, when the county was established in 1818.) in 1860, lincoln noted that the family's move to indiana was ""partly on account of slavery"", but mainly due to land title difficulties.

in kentucky and indiana, thomas worked as a farmer, cabinetmaker, and carpenter. he owned farms, town lots and livestock, paid taxes, sat on juries, appraised estates, served on country slave patrols, and guarded prisoners. thomas and nancy were members of a separate baptists church, which forbade alcohol, dancing, and slavery.

overcoming financial challenges, thomas eventually obtained clear title to of land in what became known as the little pigeon creek community.

on october 5, 1818, nancy lincoln died of milk sickness, leaving 11-year-old sarah in charge of a household that included her father, 9-year-old abraham, and dennis hanks, nancy's 19-year-old orphaned cousin. ten years later, on january 20, 1828, sarah died while giving birth to a stillborn son. lincoln was very distraught over his sister's death.

on december 2, 1819, thomas married sarah ""sally"" bush johnston, a widow from elizabethtown, kentucky, with three children of her own. abraham became close to his stepmother, whom he referred to as ""mother"". lincoln disliked the hard labor associated with farm life. he was called lazy for all his ""reading, scribbling, writing, ciphering, writing poetry, etc."". his stepmother acknowledged he did not enjoy ""physical labor"", but loved to read.

lincoln was largely self-educated. his formal schooling (from travelling teachers) was intermittent, totaling less than 12 months; however, he was an avid reader and retained a lifelong interest in learning. family, neighbors, and schoolmates recalled that he read and reread the king james bible, aesop's fables, john bunyan's ""the pilgrim's progress"", daniel defoe's ""robinson crusoe"", mason locke weems's ""the life of washington"", and ""the autobiography of benjamin franklin"", among others.

teenaged lincoln took responsibility for chores. he accepted the customary practice that a son give his father all earnings from work outside the home until age 21. lincoln became adept at using an axe. tall for his age, lincoln was strong and athletic. he became known for his strength and audacity after winning a wrestling match with the renowned leader of a group of ruffians known as ""the clary's grove boys"".

in early march 1830, partly out of fear of a milk sickness outbreak, several members of the extended lincoln family moved west to illinois, a free state, and settled in macon county, west of decatur. historians disagree on who initiated the move; thomas lincoln had no obvious reason to do so. one possibility is that other members of the family, including dennis hanks, might not have matched thomas's stability and steady income.

after the family relocated to illinois, abraham became increasingly distant from thomas, in part because of his father's lack of education, although occasionally lending him money. in 1831, as thomas and other family prepared to move to a new homestead in coles county, illinois, abraham left home. he lived in new salem for six years. lincoln and some friends took goods by flatboat to new orleans, where he witnessed slavery firsthand.

according to some sources, lincoln's first romantic interest was ann rutledge, whom he met when he first moved to new salem; these sources indicate that by 1835, they were in a relationship but not formally engaged. she died on august 25, 1835, most likely of typhoid fever. in the early 1830s, he met mary owens from kentucky.

late in 1836, lincoln agreed to a match with owens if she returned to new salem. owens arrived in november 1836, and lincoln courted her for a time; however, they both had second thoughts. on august 16, 1837, lincoln wrote owens a letter suggesting he would not blame her if she ended the relationship. she never replied.

in 1840, lincoln became engaged to mary todd, a daughter of robert smith todd, a wealthy slave-owner in lexington, kentucky. they met in springfield, illinois in december 1839 and were engaged a year later. a wedding set for january 1, 1841, was canceled at lincoln's initiative. they reconciled and married on november 4, 1842, in the springfield mansion of mary's married sister. while anxiously preparing for the nuptials, lincoln was asked where he was going and replied, ""to hell, i suppose."" in 1844, the couple bought a house in springfield near lincoln's law office. mary kept house, often with the help of a relative or hired servant.

he was an affectionate, though often absent, husband and father of four children. robert todd lincoln was born in 1843 and edward baker lincoln (eddie) in 1846. edward died on february 1, 1850, in springfield, probably of tuberculosis. ""willie"" lincoln was born on december 21, 1850, and died of a fever on february 20, 1862. the lincolns' fourth son, thomas ""tad"" lincoln, was born on april 4, 1853, and died of heart failure at the age of 18 on july 16, 1871. robert reached adulthood and produced children. the lincolns' last descendant, great-grandson robert todd lincoln beckwith, died in 1985. lincoln ""was remarkably fond of children"", and the lincolns were not considered to be strict with their own. in fact, lincoln's law partner william h. herndon would grow irritated when lincoln would bring his children to the law office. their father, it seemed, was often too absorbed in his own work to notice his children's behaviour. herndon recounted, ""i have felt many and many a time that i wanted to wring their little necks, and yet out of respect for lincoln i kept my mouth shut. lincoln did not note what his children were doing or had done.""

the deaths of their sons had profound effects on both parents. abraham suffered from ""melancholy"", a condition later referred to as clinical depression. later in life, mary struggled with the stresses of losing her husband and sons, and robert committed her temporarily to a mental health asylum in 1875.

lincoln's father-in-law and others of the todd family were either slave owners or slave traders. lincoln was close to the todds, and he and his family occasionally visited them.

mary cooked for lincoln often during his presidency. raised by a wealthy family, her cooking was simple, but satisfied lincoln's tastes, which included imported oysters.

in 1832, lincoln and partner denton offutt bought a general store on credit in new salem, illinois. although the economy was booming, the business struggled and lincoln eventually sold his share. that march he entered politics, running for the illinois general assembly, advocating navigational improvements on the sangamon river. he could draw crowds as a raconteur, but he lacked an education, powerful friends, and money and lost the election.

lincoln interrupted his campaign to briefly serve as a captain in the illinois militia (during the black hawk war). he then returned to his campaign. at his first speech, he observed a supporter in the crowd under attack, grabbed the assailant by his ""neck and the seat of his trousers"" and tossed him. lincoln finished eighth out of 13 candidates (the top four were elected), though he received 277 of the 300 votes cast in the new salem precinct.

lincoln served as new salem's postmaster and later as county surveyor, all the while reading voraciously. he decided to become a lawyer and began teaching himself law by reading blackstone's ""commentaries on the laws of england"" and other law books. of his learning method, lincoln stated: ""i studied with nobody"".

his second state legislature campaign in 1834 was successful. although he ran as a whig, many democrats favored him over a more powerful whig opponent. lincoln served four successive terms in the illinois house of representatives as a whig from sangamon county. he supported the construction of the illinois and michigan canal, later serving as a canal commissioner. in the 1835â36 legislative session, he voted to expand suffrage beyond white landowners to all white males. he was known for his ""free soil"" stance of opposing both slavery and abolitionism. he first articulated this in 1837, saying, ""[the] institution of slavery is founded on both injustice and bad policy, but the promulgation of abolition doctrines tends rather to increase than abate its evils."" he followed henry clay in supporting the american colonization society program of advocating abolition and helping freed slaves to settle in liberia.

admitted to the illinois bar in 1836, he moved to springfield, illinois, and began to practice law under john t. stuart, mary todd's cousin. lincoln developed a reputation as a formidable adversary during cross-examinations and closing arguments. he partnered with stephen t. logan from 1841 until 1844. then lincoln began his practice with william herndon, whom lincoln thought ""a studious young man"".

from the early 1830s, lincoln was a steadfast whig and professed to friends in 1861 to be ""an old line whig, a disciple of henry clay"". the party, including lincoln, favored economic modernization in banking, tariffs to fund internal improvements including railroads, and urbanization.

lincoln ran for the whig nomination for illinois's 7th district of the u.s. house of representatives in 1843, but was defeated by john j. hardin. however, lincoln won support for the principle of rotation, whereby hardin would retire after only one term. lincoln hoped that this arrangement would lead to his nomination in 1846. lincoln was indeed elected to the house of representatives in 1846, where he served one two-year term. he was the only whig in the illinois delegation, showing party loyalty by participating in almost all votes and making speeches that echoed the party line. lincoln, in collaboration with abolitionist congressman joshua r. giddings, wrote a bill to abolish slavery in the district of columbia with compensation for the owners, enforcement to capture fugitive slaves, and a popular vote on the matter. he abandoned the bill when it failed to garner sufficient whig supporters.


on foreign and military policy, lincoln spoke out against the mexicanâamerican war, which he attributed to president james k. polk's desire for ""military gloryâthat attractive rainbow, that rises in showers of blood"". lincoln supported the wilmot proviso, which if passed would have banned slavery in any u.s. territory won from mexico.

lincoln emphasized his opposition to polk by drafting and introducing his spot resolutions. the war had begun with a mexican slaughter of american soldiers in territory disputed by mexico, and polk insisted that mexican soldiers had ""invaded our territory and shed the blood of our fellow-citizens on our own soil"". lincoln demanded that polk show congress the exact spot on which blood had been shed and prove that the spot was on american soil.

congress neither debated nor enacted the resolution, the national papers ignored it, and it cost lincoln political support in his district. one illinois newspaper derisively nicknamed him ""spotty lincoln"". lincoln later regretted some of his statements, especially his attack on presidential war-making powers.

realizing clay was unlikely to win the presidency, lincoln, who had pledged in 1846 to serve only one term in the house, supported general zachary taylor for the whig nomination in the 1848 presidential election. taylor won and lincoln hoped to be appointed commissioner of the general land office, but lost out. the administration offered him the consolation prize of secretary or governor of the oregon territory. this distant territory was a democratic stronghold, and acceptance of the post would have effectively ended his legal and political career in illinois, so he declined and resumed his law practice.

lincoln practiced law in springfield, handling ""every kind of business that could come before a prairie lawyer"". twice a year for 16 years, 10 weeks at a time, he appeared in county seats in the midstate region when the county courts were in session. lincoln handled transportation cases in the midst of the nation's western expansion, particularly river barge conflicts under the many new railroad bridges. as a riverboat man, lincoln initially favored those interests, but ultimately represented whoever hired him. he later represented a bridge company against a riverboat company in a landmark case involving a canal boat that sank after hitting a bridge. in 1849, he received a patent for a flotation device for the movement of boats in shallow water. the idea was never commercialized, but lincoln is the only president to hold a patent.

in 1851, he represented the alton & sangamon railroad in a dispute with shareholder james a. barret, who had refused to pay the balance on his pledge to buy shares on the grounds that the company had changed its original train route. lincoln successfully argued that the railroad company was not bound by its original charter; the charter was amended in the public interest to provide a newer, superior, and less expensive route, and the corporation retained the right to demand barret's payment. the decision by the illinois supreme court was cited by many other courts. lincoln appeared before the illinois supreme court in 175 cases, in 51 as sole counsel, of which 31 were decided in his favor. from 1853 to 1860, another of lincoln's largest clients was the illinois central railroad. lincoln's legal reputation gave rise to his nickname ""honest abe"".

lincoln's most notable criminal trial occurred in 1858 when he defended william ""duff"" armstrong, who was on trial for the murder of james preston metzker. the case is famous for lincoln's use of a fact established by judicial notice in order to challenge the credibility of an eyewitness. after an opposing witness testified to seeing the crime in the moonlight, lincoln produced a ""farmers' almanac"" showing the moon was at a low angle, drastically reducing visibility. armstrong was acquitted.

lincoln rarely raised objections; but in an 1859 case, where he defended a cousin, peachy harrison, who was accused of killing a man, lincoln angrily protested the judge's decision to exclude evidence favorable to his client. instead of holding lincoln in contempt of court as was expected, the judge, a democrat, reversed his ruling, allowing the evidence and acquitting harrison.

the debate over the status of slavery in the territories exacerbated sectional tensions between the slave-holding south and the free north. the compromise of 1850 failed to defuse the issue. in the early 1850s, lincoln supported sectional mediation, and his 1852 eulogy for clay focused on the latter's support for gradual emancipation and opposition to ""both extremes"" on the slavery issue. as the 1850s progressed, the debate over slavery in the nebraska territory and kansas territory became particularly acrimonious, and senator douglas proposed popular sovereignty as a compromise measure; the proposal would allow the electorate of each territory to decide the status of slavery. the proposal alarmed many northerners, who hoped to prevent the spread of slavery into the territories. despite this northern opposition, douglas's kansasânebraska act narrowly passed congress in may 1854.

for months after its passage, lincoln did not publicly comment, but he came to strongly oppose it. on october 16, 1854, in his ""peoria speech"", lincoln declared his opposition to slavery, which he repeated en route to the presidency. speaking in his kentucky accent, with a powerful voice, he said the kansas act had a """"declared"" indifference, but as i must think, a covert ""real"" zeal for the spread of slavery. i cannot but hate it. i hate it because of the monstrous injustice of slavery itself. i hate it because it deprives our republican example of its just influence in the worldâ ..."" lincoln's attacks on the kansasânebraska act marked his return to political life.

nationally, the whigs were irreparably split by the kansasânebraska act and other efforts to compromise on the slavery issue. reflecting the demise of his party, lincoln wrote in 1855, ""i think i am a whig, but others say there are no whigs, and that i am an abolitionist [...] i do no more than oppose the ""extension"" of slavery."" drawing on the antislavery portion of the whig party, and combining free soil, liberty, and antislavery democratic party members, the new republican party formed as a northern party dedicated to antislavery. lincoln resisted early recruiting attempts, fearing that it would serve as a platform for extreme abolitionists. lincoln hoped to rejuvenate the whigs, though he lamented his party's growing closeness with the nativist know nothing movement.

in the 1854 elections, lincoln was elected to the illinois legislature but declined to take his seat. in the elections' aftermath, which showed the power and popularity of the movement opposed to the kansasânebraska act, lincoln instead sought election to the united states senate. at that time, senators were elected by the state legislature. after leading in the first six rounds of voting, he was unable to obtain a majority. lincoln instructed his backers to vote for lyman trumbull. trumbull was an antislavery democrat, and had received few votes in the earlier ballots; his supporters, also antislavery democrats, had vowed not to support any whig. lincoln's decision to withdraw enabled his whig supporters and trumbull's antislavery democrats to combine and defeat the mainstream democratic candidate, joel aldrich matteson.

in part due to the ongoing violent political confrontations in kansas, opposition to the kansasânebraska act remained strong throughout the north. as the 1856 elections approached, lincoln joined the republicans. he attended the may 1856 bloomington convention, which formally established the illinois republican party. the convention platform asserted that congress had the right to regulate slavery in the territories and called for the immediate admission of kansas as a free state. lincoln gave the final speech of the convention, in which he endorsed the party platform and called for the preservation of the union. at the june 1856 republican national convention, lincoln received significant support to run for vice president, though the party nominated william dayton to run with john c. frã©mont. lincoln supported the republican ticket, campaigning throughout illinois. the democrats nominated former ambassador james buchanan, who had been out of the country since 1853 and thus had avoided the slavery debate, while the know nothings nominated former whig president millard fillmore. buchanan defeated both his challengers. republican william henry bissell won election as governor of illinois. lincoln's vigorous campaigning had made him the leading republican in illinois.

eric foner (2010) contrasts the abolitionists and anti-slavery radical republicans of the northeast, who saw slavery as a sin, with the conservative republicans, who thought it was bad because it hurt white people and blocked progress. foner argues that lincoln was a moderate in the middle, opposing slavery primarily because it violated the republicanism principles of the founding fathers, especially the equality of all men and democratic self-government as expressed in the declaration of independence.

in march 1857, in ""dred scott v. sandford,"" supreme court chief justice roger b. taney wrote that blacks were not citizens and derived no rights from the constitution. while many democrats hoped that ""dred scott"" would end the dispute over slavery in the territories, the decision sparked further outrage in the north. lincoln denounced it, alleging it was the product of a conspiracy of democrats to support the slave power. lincoln argued, ""the authors of the declaration of independence never intended 'to say all were equal in color, size, intellect, moral developments, or social capacity', but they 'did consider all men created equalâequal in certain inalienable rights, among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness'.""

douglas was up for re-election in 1858, and lincoln hoped to defeat him. with the former democrat trumbull now serving as a republican senator, many in the party felt that a former whig should be nominated in 1858, and lincoln's 1856 campaigning and willingness to support trumbull in 1854 had earned him favor. some eastern republicans favored douglas's re-election in 1858, since he had led the opposition to the lecompton constitution, which would have admitted kansas as a slave state. many illinois republicans resented this eastern interference. for the first time, illinois republicans held a convention to agree upon a senate candidate, and lincoln won the nomination with little opposition.

accepting the nomination, lincoln delivered his house divided speech, drawing on , ""a house divided against itself cannot stand. i believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free. i do not expect the union to be dissolvedâi do not expect the house to fallâbut i do expect it will cease to be divided. it will become all one thing, or all the other."" the speech created an evocative image of the danger of disunion. the stage was then set for the campaign for statewide election of the illinois legislature which would, in turn, select lincoln or douglas. when informed of lincoln's nomination, douglas stated, ""[lincoln] is the strong man of the partyâ ... and if i beat him, my victory will be hardly won.""

the senate campaign featured seven debates, the most famous political debates in american history. the principals stood in stark contrast both physically and politically. lincoln warned that ""the slave power"" was threatening the values of republicanism, and accused douglas of distorting the values of the founding fathers that all men are created equal, while douglas emphasized his freeport doctrine, that local settlers were free to choose whether to allow slavery, and accused lincoln of having joined the abolitionists. the debates had an atmosphere of a prize fight and drew crowds in the thousands. lincoln's argument was rooted in morality. he claimed that douglas represented a conspiracy to extend slavery to free states. douglas's argument was legal, claiming that lincoln was defying the authority of the u.s. supreme court and the ""dred scott"" decision.

though the republican legislative candidates won more popular votes, the democrats won more seats, and the legislature re-elected douglas. lincoln's articulation of the issues gave him a national political presence. in may 1859, lincoln purchased the ""illinois staats-anzeiger"", a german-language newspaper that was consistently supportive; most of the state's 130,000 german americans voted democratic but the german-language paper mobilized republican support. in the aftermath of the 1858 election, newspapers frequently mentioned lincoln as a potential republican presidential candidate, rivaled by william h. seward, salmon p. chase, edward bates, and simon cameron. while lincoln was popular in the midwest, he lacked support in the northeast, and was unsure whether to seek the office. in january 1860, lincoln told a group of political allies that he would accept the nomination if offered, and in the following months several local papers endorsed his candidacy.

on february 27, 1860, new york party leaders invited lincoln to give a speech at cooper union to a group of powerful republicans. lincoln argued that the founding fathers had little use for popular sovereignty and had repeatedly sought to restrict slavery. lincoln insisted that morality required opposition to slavery, and rejected any ""groping for some middle ground between the right and the wrong"". despite his inelegant appearanceâmany in the audience thought him awkward and even uglyâlincoln demonstrated intellectual leadership that brought him into contention. journalist noah brooks reported, ""no man ever before made such an impression on his first appeal to a new york audience.""

historian david herbert donald described the speech as a ""superb political move for an unannounced candidate, to appear in one rival's (seward) own state at an event sponsored by the second rival's (chase) loyalists, while not mentioning either by name during its delivery"". in response to an inquiry about his ambitions, lincoln said, ""the taste ""is"" in my mouth a little.""

on may 9â10, 1860, the illinois republican state convention was held in decatur. lincoln's followers organized a campaign team led by david davis, norman judd, leonard swett, and jesse dubois, and lincoln received his first endorsement. exploiting his embellished frontier legend (clearing land and splitting fence rails), lincoln's supporters adopted the label of ""the rail candidate"". in 1860, lincoln described himself: ""i am in height, six feet, four inches, nearly; lean in flesh, weighing, on an average, one hundred and eighty pounds; dark complexion, with coarse black hair, and gray eyes.""

on may 18, at the republican national convention in chicago, lincoln won the nomination on the third ballot, beating candidates such as seward and chase. a former democrat, hannibal hamlin of maine, was nominated for vice president to balance the ticket. lincoln's success depended on his campaign team, his reputation as a moderate on the slavery issue, and his strong support for whiggish programs of internal improvements and the tariff.

pennsylvania put him over the top, led by pennsylvania iron interests who were reassured by his tariff support. lincoln's managers had focused on this delegation, while following lincoln's dictate to ""make no contracts that bind me"".

most republicans agreed with lincoln that the north was the aggrieved party, as the slave power tightened its grasp on the national government. throughout the 1850s, lincoln doubted the prospects of civil war, and his supporters rejected claims that his election would incite secession. douglas was selected as the candidate of the northern democrats. delegates from eleven slave states walked out of the democratic convention, disagreeing with douglas's position on popular sovereignty, and ultimately selected incumbent vice president john c. breckinridge as their candidate. a group of former whigs and know nothings formed the constitutional union party and nominated john bell of tennessee. lincoln and douglas competed for votes in the north, while bell and breckinridge primarily found support in the south.

lincoln's campaign team carefully projected his image as an ideal candidate. michael martinez wrote:

prior to the republican convention, the lincoln campaign began cultivating a nationwide youth organization, the wide awakes, which it used to generate popular support throughout the country to spearhead voter registration drives, thinking that new voters and young voters tended to embrace new parties. lincoln's ideas of abolishing slavery grew, drawing more supporters. people of the northern states knew the southern states would vote against lincoln and rallied supporters for lincoln.

as douglas and the other candidates campaigned, lincoln was the only one to give no speeches. instead, he relied on the enthusiasm of the republican party. the party did the leg work that produced majorities across the north, and produced an abundance of campaign posters, leaflets, and newspaper editorials. thousands of republican speakers focused first on the party platform, and second on lincoln's life story, emphasizing his childhood poverty. the goal was to demonstrate the superior power of ""free labor"", whereby a common farm boy could work his way to the top by his own efforts. the republican party's production of campaign literature dwarfed the combined opposition; a ""chicago tribune"" writer produced a pamphlet that detailed lincoln's life, and sold 100,000â200,000 copies.

on november 6, lincoln was elected the 16th president of the united states. he was the first republican president and his victory was entirely due to his support in the north and west; no ballots were cast for him in 10 of the 15 southern slave states, and he won only two of 996 counties in all the southern states. lincoln received 1,866,452 votes, or 39.8% of the total in a four-way race. he won the free northern states, as well as california and oregon.

lincoln's victory in the electoral college was decisive: lincoln had 180 and his opponents added together had only 123.

after the november election, secessionists planned to leave the union before he took office in march. on december 20, 1860, south carolina took the lead by adopting an ordinance of secession; by february 1, 1861, florida, mississippi, alabama, georgia, louisiana, and texas had followed. six of these states declared themselves to be a sovereign nation, the confederate states of america and adopted a constitution. the upper south and border states (delaware, maryland, virginia, north carolina, tennessee, kentucky, missouri, and arkansas) listened to, but initially rejected, the secessionist appeal. president buchanan and president-elect lincoln refused to recognize the confederacy, declaring secession illegal. the confederacy selected jefferson davis as its provisional president on february 9, 1861.

attempts at compromise followed. lincoln and the republicans rejected the proposed crittenden compromise as contrary to the party's free-soil in the territories platform. lincoln rejected the idea, saying, ""i will suffer death before i consentâ ... to any concession or compromise which looks like buying the privilege to take possession of this government to which we have a constitutional right.""

lincoln did tacitly support the proposed corwin amendment to the constitution, which passed congress before lincoln came into office and was then awaiting ratification by the states. that proposed amendment would have protected slavery in states where it already existed. a few weeks before the war, lincoln sent a letter to every governor informing them congress had passed a joint resolution to amend the constitution. lincoln was open to the possibility of a constitutional convention to make further amendments to the constitution.

en route to his inauguration, lincoln addressed crowds and legislatures across the north. the president-elect evaded possible assassins in baltimore. on february 23, 1861, he arrived in disguise in washington, d.c., which was placed under substantial military guard. lincoln directed his inaugural address to the south, proclaiming once again that he had no intention, or inclination, to abolish slavery in the southern states:

lincoln cited his plans for banning the expansion of slavery as the key source of conflict between north and south, stating ""one section of our country believes slavery is right and ought to be extended, while the other believes it is wrong and ought not to be extended. this is the only substantial dispute."" the president ended his address with an appeal to the people of the south: ""we are not enemies, but friends. we must not be enemiesâ ... the mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battlefield, and patriot grave, to every living heart and hearthstone, all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the union, when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature."" the failure of the peace conference of 1861 signaled that legislative compromise was impossible. by march 1861, no leaders of the insurrection had proposed rejoining the union on any terms. meanwhile, lincoln and the republican leadership agreed that the dismantling of the union could not be tolerated. lincoln said in his second inaugural address:

fort sumter's commander, major robert anderson, sent a request for provisions to washington, and the execution of lincoln's order to meet that request was seen by the secessionists as an act of war. on april 12, 1861, confederate forces fired on union troops at fort sumter and began the fight. historian allan nevins argued that the newly inaugurated lincoln made three miscalculations: underestimating the gravity of the crisis, exaggerating the strength of unionist sentiment in the south, and not realizing the southern unionists were insisting there be no invasion.

william tecumseh sherman talked to lincoln during inauguration week and was ""sadly disappointed"" at his failure to realize that ""the country was sleeping on a volcano"" and that the south was preparing for war. donald concludes that, ""his repeated efforts to avoid collision in the months between inauguration and the firing on ft. sumter showed he adhered to his vow not to be the first to shed fraternal blood. but he also vowed not to surrender the forts. the only resolution of these contradictory positions was for the confederates to fire the first shot; they did just that.""

on april 15, lincoln called on the states to send detachments totaling 75,000 troops to recapture forts, protect washington, and ""preserve the union"", which, in his view, remained intact despite the seceding states. this call forced states to choose sides. virginia seceded and was rewarded with the confederate capital, despite the exposed position of richmond close to union lines. north carolina, tennessee, and arkansas followed over the following two months. secession sentiment was strong in missouri and maryland, but did not prevail; kentucky remained neutral. the fort sumter attack rallied americans north of the mason-dixon line to defend the nation.

states sent union regiments south. on april 19, mobs in baltimore, which controlled rail links, attacked union troops who were changing trains. local leaders' groups later burned critical rail bridges to the capital. the army responded by arresting local maryland officials. lincoln suspended the writ of ""habeas corpus"" in areas the army felt it needed to secure for troops to reach washington. john merryman, a maryland official involved in hindering the u.s. troop movements, petitioned supreme court chief justice and marylander, roger b. taney, author of the ""dred scott"" opinion, to issue a writ of ""habeas corpus."" in june taney, acting as a circuit judge and not speaking for the supreme court, issued the writ, because in his opinion only congress could suspend the writ. lincoln continued the army policy that the writ was suspended in limited areas despite the ex parte merryman ruling.

after the battle of fort sumter, lincoln took executive control of the war and formed an overall union military strategy. lincoln responded to this unprecedented political and military crisis as commander-in-chief, using unprecedented powers. he expanded his war powers, imposed a blockade on confederate ports, disbursed funds before appropriation by congress, suspended ""habeas corpus"", and arrested and imprisoned thousands of suspected confederate sympathizers. lincoln was supported by congress and the northern public for these actions. in addition, lincoln had to reinforce union sympathies in the border slave states and keep the war from becoming an international conflict.

the war dominated lincoln's time and attention. from the start, it was clear that bipartisan support would be essential to success, and that any compromise would alienate factions on both sides of the aisle, such as the appointment of republicans and democrats to command positions. copperheads criticized lincoln for refusing to compromise on slavery. the radical republicans criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery. on august 6, 1861, lincoln signed the confiscation act that authorized judicial proceedings to confiscate and free slaves who were used to support the confederates. in practice, the law had little effect, but it did signal political support for abolishing slavery.

in late august 1861, general john c. frã©mont, the 1856 republican presidential nominee, without consulting his superiors in washington, proclaimed a very harsh martial law in missouri. lincoln cancelled the proclamation, saying its emancipation plan was political, lacking military necessity and a legal basis. after lincoln acted, union enlistments from maryland, kentucky, and missouri increased by over 40,000.

in foreign policy, lincoln's main goal was to stop military aid to the confederacy. lincoln left most diplomatic matters to his secretary of state, william seward. at times seward was too bellicose, so for balance lincoln maintained a close working relationship with senate foreign relations committee chairman charles sumner. the trent affair of late 1861 threatened war with great britain. the u.s. navy had illegally intercepted a british mail ship, the ""trent"", on the high seas and seized two confederate envoys; britain protested vehemently while the u.s. cheered. lincoln ended the crisis by releasing the two diplomats. biographer james g. randall dissected lincoln's successful techniques:
lincoln painstakingly monitored the telegraph reports coming into war department. he tracked all phases of the effort, consulted with governors, and selected generals based on their success (as well as their state and party). in january 1862, after many complaints of inefficiency and profiteering in the war department, lincoln replaced simon cameron with edwin stanton as war secretary. stanton centralized the war department's activities, auditing and cancelling contracts, saving the federal government $17,000,000. stanton was a staunchly unionist, pro-business, conservative democrat who moved toward the radical republican faction. he worked more often and more closely with lincoln than any other senior official. ""stanton and lincoln virtually conducted the war together,"" say thomas and hyman.

in terms of war strategy, lincoln articulated two priorities: to ensure that washington was well-defended, and to conduct an aggressive war effort leading to prompt, decisive victory. however major northern newspapers demanded moreâthey expected victory within 90 days. twice a week, lincoln met with his cabinet in the afternoon. occasionally mary would force him to take a carriage ride, concerned that he was working too hard. lincoln learned from reading his chief of staff general henry halleck's book, a disciple of the european strategist jomini; he began to appreciate the critical need to control strategic points, such as the mississippi river. lincoln saw the importance of vicksburg and understood the necessity of defeating the enemy's army, rather than simply capturing territory.

after the union rout at bull run and winfield scott's retirement, lincoln appointed major general george b. mcclellan general-in-chief. mcclellan then took months to plan his peninsula campaign. mcclellan's slow progress frustrated lincoln, as did his position that no troops were needed to defend washington. mcclellan blamed lincoln's holding troops back for his campaign's subsequent failure. lincoln went as far as meeting with general mcclellan in his home to discuss matters privately. once mcclellan heard lincoln was in his home, mcclellan stayed hidden away until lincoln left.
lincoln removed mcclellan in march 1862, after mcclellan offered unsolicited political advice. in july lincoln elevated henry halleck. lincoln appointed john pope as head of the new army of virginia. pope complied with lincoln's desire to advance on richmond from the north, thus protecting washington from counterattack.

pope was then soundly defeated at the second battle of bull run in the summer of 1862, forcing the army of the potomac back to defend washington.

despite his dissatisfaction with mcclellan's failure to reinforce pope, lincoln restored him to command of all forces around washington. two days after mcclellan's return to command, general robert e. lee's forces crossed the potomac river into maryland, leading to the battle of antietam in september. the ensuing union victory was among the bloodiest in american history, but it enabled lincoln to announce that he would issue an emancipation proclamation in january. lincoln had waited for a military victory so that the proclamation would not be perceived as the product of desperation.

mcclellan then resisted the president's demand that he pursue lee's army, while general don carlos buell likewise refused orders to move the army of the ohio against rebel forces in eastern tennessee. lincoln replaced buell with william rosecrans; and, after the 1862 midterm elections, replaced mcclellan with ambrose burnside. both were presumably more supportive of the commander-in-chief.

burnside, against presidential advice, launched an offensive across the rappahannock river and was defeated by lee at fredericksburg in december. desertions during 1863 came in the thousands and increased after fredericksburg. lincoln promoted joseph hooker.

the midterm elections in 1862 cost the republicans severe losses due to rising inflation, high taxes, rumors of corruption, suspension of ""habeas corpus"", military draft law, and fears that freed slaves would come north and undermine the labor market. the emancipation proclamation gained votes for republicans in rural new england and the upper midwest, but cost votes in the irish and german strongholds and in the lower midwest, where many southerners had lived for generations.

in the spring of 1863, lincoln became optimistic about upcoming military campaigns to the point of thinking the end of the war could be near if a string of victories could be put together; these plans included attacks by hooker on lee north of richmond, rosecrans on chattanooga, grant on vicksburg, and a naval assault on charleston.

hooker was routed by lee at the battle of chancellorsville in may. he then resigned and was replaced by george meade as lee moved north. meade followed lee into pennsylvania and beat him in the gettysburg campaign, but then failed to follow up despite lincoln's demands. at the same time, grant captured vicksburg and gained control of the mississippi river, splitting off the far western rebel states.

the federal government's power to end slavery was limited by the constitution, which before 1865, committed the issue to individual states. lincoln argued that slavery would end by preventing its expansion into new territories. he sought to persuade the states to accept compensated emancipation in return for their prohibition of slavery. lincoln believed that curtailing slavery would make it obsolete. lincoln rejected fremont's two emancipation attempts in august 1861 and one by major general david hunter in may 1862, on the grounds that it was not within their power, and would upset loyal border states.

on june 19, 1862, endorsed by lincoln, congress passed an act banning slavery on all federal territory. in july, the confiscation act of 1862 was enacted, which set up court procedures to free the slaves of those convicted of aiding the rebellion. although lincoln believed this was not within congress's power, he approved the bill in deference to the legislature. he felt such action could be taken only by the commander-in-chief, using constitutional war powers, which he planned to do. lincoln discussed a draft of the emancipation proclamation with his cabinet.

privately, lincoln concluded that the confederacy's slave base had to be eliminated. however, copperheads argued that emancipation was a stumbling block to peace and reunification. republican editor horace greeley of the ""new york tribune"" agreed. lincoln rejected this argument directly in his letter of august 22, 1862. although he said he personally wished all men could be free, lincoln stated that the primary goal of his actions as president (he used the first person pronoun and explicitly refers to his ""official duty"") was that of preserving the union:

the emancipation proclamation, issued on september 22, 1862, with effect on january 1, 1863, declared free the slaves in 10 states not then under union control, with exemptions specified for areas under union control in two states. lincoln spent the next 100 days preparing the army and the nation for emancipation, while democrats rallied their voters by warning of the threat that freed slaves posed to northern whites.

once the abolition of slavery in the rebel states became a military objective, union armies advancing south liberated three million slaves. lincoln's comment on the signing of the proclamation was: ""i never, in my life, felt more certain that i was doing right, than i do in signing this paper."" lincoln continued earlier plans to set up colonies for the newly freed slaves. he supported this in the proclamation, but the undertaking failed.

enlisting former slaves became official policy. by the spring of 1863, lincoln was ready to recruit black troops in more than token numbers. in a letter to tennessee military governor andrew johnson encouraging him to lead the way in raising black troops, lincoln wrote, ""the bare sight of 50,000 armed and drilled black soldiers on the banks of the mississippi would end the rebellion at once"". by the end of 1863, at lincoln's direction, general lorenzo thomas had recruited 20 regiments of blacks from the mississippi valley.

lincoln spoke at the gettysburg battlefield cemetery on november 19, 1863. defying his prediction that ""the world will little note, nor long remember what we say here"", the address became the most quoted speech in american history.

in 272 words, and three minutes, lincoln asserted that the nation was born not in 1789, but in 1776, ""conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal"". he defined the war as dedicated to the principles of liberty and equality for all. he declared that the deaths of so many brave soldiers would not be in vain, that slavery would end, and the future of democracy would be assured, that ""government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth"".

grant's victories at the battle of shiloh and in the vicksburg campaign impressed lincoln. responding to criticism of grant after shiloh, lincoln had said, ""i can't spare this man. he fights."" with grant in command, lincoln felt the union army could advance in multiple theaters, and incorporate black troops. meade's failure to capture lee's army after gettysburg and the continued passivity of the army of the potomac persuaded lincoln to promote grant to supreme commander. grant stayed with meade's army and told meade what to do.

lincoln was concerned that grant might be considering a presidential candidacy in 1864, as was mcclellan. lincoln arranged for an intermediary to inquire into grant's political intentions. assured that he had none, lincoln submitted grant's appointment to the senate. he obtained congress's consent to make him lieutenant general, a rank that had remained unoccupied since george washington.

grant waged his bloody overland campaign in 1864, with heavy losses on both sides. despite this, when lincoln asked what grant's plans were, the general replied, ""i propose to fight it out on this line if it takes all summer.""

grant's army moved steadily south. lincoln traveled to grant's headquarters at city point, virginia to confer with grant and william tecumseh sherman. lincoln replaced the union losses by mobilizing support throughout the north.

lincoln authorized grant to target infrastructureâplantations, railroads, and bridgesâhoping to destroy the south's morale and weaken its fighting ability. lincoln emphasized defeat of the confederate armies rather than destruction (which was considerable) for its own sake.

in 1864 confederate general jubal early raided washington, d.c., while lincoln watched from an exposed position; captain oliver wendell holmes shouted at him, ""get down, you damn fool, before you get shot!""

as grant continued to attrit lee's forces, efforts to discuss peace began. confederate vice president stephens led a group to meet with lincoln, seward, and others at hampton roads. lincoln refused to allow any negotiation with the confederacy as a coequal; his sole objective was an agreement to end the fighting and the meetings produced no results. on april 1, 1865, grant nearly encircled petersburg. the confederate government evacuated and the city fell. lincoln visited the conquered capital. on april 9, lee surrendered to grant at appomattox officially ending the war.

lincoln ran again in 1864. he united the main republican factions, along with war democrats such as edwin m. stanton and andrew johnson. lincoln used conversation and his patronage powersâgreatly expanded from peacetimeâto build support and fend off the radicals' efforts to replace him. at its convention, the republicans selected johnson as his running mate. to broaden his coalition to include war democrats as well as republicans, lincoln ran under the label of the new union party.

grant's bloody stalemates damaged lincoln's re-election prospects, and many republicans feared defeat. lincoln confidentially pledged in writing that if he should lose the election, he would still defeat the confederacy before turning over the white house: lincoln did not show the pledge to his cabinet, but asked them to sign the sealed envelope.

while the democratic platform followed the ""peace wing"" of the party and called the war a ""failure"", their candidate, mcclellan, supported the war and repudiated the platform. lincoln provided grant with more troops and led his party to renew its support for grant. sherman's capture of atlanta in september and david farragut's capture of mobile ended defeatism. the democratic party was deeply split, with some leaders and most soldiers openly for lincoln. the national union party was united by lincoln's support for emancipation. state republican parties stressed the perfidy of the copperheads. on november 8, lincoln carried all but three states, including 78 percent of union soldiers.
on march 4, 1865, lincoln delivered his second inaugural address. in it, he deemed the endless casualties to be god's will. historian mark noll claims this speech to rank ""among the small handful of semi-sacred texts by which americans conceive their place in the world"". lincoln said:

reconstruction began during the war, as lincoln and his associates considered how to reintegrate the nation, and the fates of confederate leaders and freed slaves. shortly after lee's surrender, a general asked lincoln how to treat defeated confederates. lincoln replied, ""let 'em up easy."" lincoln was determined to find meaning in the war even when it had passed, and did not want to continue to outcast the southern states. his main goal was to keep the union together. he planned to go forward not by focusing on who to blame, but on how to rebuild the nation as one. lincoln led the moderates regarding reconstruction policy, and was opposed by the radicals, under rep. thaddeus stevens, sen. charles sumner and sen. benjamin wade, who otherwise remained lincoln's allies. determined to reunite the nation and not alienate the south, lincoln urged that speedy elections under generous terms be held. his amnesty proclamation of december 8, 1863, offered pardons to those who had not held a confederate civil office, had not mistreated union prisoners, and would sign an oath of allegiance.

as southern states fell, they needed leaders while their administrations re-formed. in tennessee and arkansas, lincoln appointed johnson and frederick steele as military governors, respectively. in louisiana, lincoln ordered general nathaniel p. banks to promote a plan that would restore statehood when 10 percent of the voters agreed. democratic opponents accused lincoln of using the military to ensure his and the republicans' political aspirations. the radicals denounced his policy as too lenient, and passed their own plan, the wadeâdavis bill, in 1864, which lincoln vetoed. the radicals retaliated by refusing to seat elected representatives from louisiana, arkansas, and tennessee.

lincoln's appointments were designed to harness both moderates and radicals. to fill chief justice taney's seat on the supreme court, he named the radicals' choice, salmon p. chase, who lincoln believed would uphold his emancipation and paper money policies.

after implementing the emancipation proclamation, lincoln increased pressure on congress to outlaw slavery throughout the nation with a constitutional amendment. he declared that such an amendment would ""clinch the whole matter"". by december 1863, an amendment was brought to congress. this first attempt failed, falling short of the required two-thirds majority on june 15, 1864, in the house of representatives. passage became part of the republican/unionist platform. after a house debate, the second attempt passed on january 31, 1865. with ratification, it became the thirteenth amendment to the united states constitution on december 6, 1865.

lincoln believed the federal government had limited responsibility to the millions of freedmen. he signed senator charles sumner's freedmen's bureau bill that set up a temporary federal agency designed to meet the immediate needs of former slaves. the law opened land for a lease of three years with the ability to purchase title for the freedmen. lincoln announced a reconstruction plan that involved short-term military control, pending readmission under the control of southern unionists.

historians agree that it is impossible to predict exactly how reconstruction would have proceeded had lincoln lived. biographers james g. randall and richard current, according to david lincove, argue that:
eric foner argues that:
lincoln adhered to the whig theory of the presidency, giving congress primary responsibility for lawmaking while the executive enforced them. lincoln vetoed only four bills; the only important one was the wade-davis bill with its harsh reconstruction program. the 1862 homestead act made millions of acres of western government-held land available for purchase at low cost. the 1862 morrill land-grant colleges act provided government grants for agricultural colleges in each state. the pacific railway acts of 1862 and 1864 granted federal support for the construction of the united states' first transcontinental railroad, which was completed in 1869. the passage of the homestead act and the pacific railway acts was enabled by the absence of southern congressmen and senators who had opposed the measures in the 1850s.

in july 1861, the us issued paper currency for the first time. the currency became known greenbacks, because it was printed in green on the reverse side.
other important legislation involved two measures to raise revenues for the federal government: tariffs (a policy with long precedent), and a federal income tax. in 1861, lincoln signed the second and third morrill tariffs, following the first enacted by buchanan. also in 1861, lincoln signed the revenue act of 1861, creating the first u.s. income tax. this created a flat tax of 3 percent on incomes above $800 ($ in current dollar terms). the revenue act of 1862 adopted rates that increased with income.

lincoln presided over the expansion of the federal government's economic influence in other areas. the national banking act created the system of national banks. it also established a national currency. in 1862, congress created the department of agriculture. in 1862, lincoln sent a senior general, john pope to put down the ""sioux uprising"" in minnesota. presented with 303 execution warrants for santee dakota who were convicted of killing innocent farmers, lincoln conducted his own personal review of each warrant, eventually approving 39 for execution (one was later reprieved).

in response to rumors of a renewed draft, the editors of the ""new york world"" and the ""journal of commerce"" published a false draft proclamation that created an opportunity for the editors and others employed at the publications to corner the gold market. lincoln attacked the media about such behavior, ordering the military to seize the two papers. the seizure lasted for two days.

lincoln is largely responsible for the thanksgiving holiday. thanksgiving had become a regional holiday in new england in the 17th century. it had been sporadically proclaimed by the federal government on irregular dates. the prior proclamation had been during james madison's presidency 50 years earlier. in 1863, lincoln declared the final thursday in november of that year to be a day of thanksgiving.

in june 1864, lincoln approved the yosemite grant enacted by congress, which provided unprecedented federal protection for the area now known as yosemite national park.

lincoln's declared philosophy on court nominations was that ""we cannot ask a man what he will do, and if we should, and he should answer us, we should despise him for it. therefore we must take a man whose opinions are known."" lincoln made five appointments to the united states supreme court. noah haynes swayne was chosen as an anti-slavery lawyer who was committed to the union. samuel freeman miller, supported lincoln in the 1860 election and was an avowed abolitionist. david davis was lincoln's campaign manager in 1860 and had served as a judge in lincoln's illinois court circuit. democrat stephen johnson field, a previous california supreme court justice, provided geographic and political balance. finally, lincoln's treasury secretary, salmon p. chase, became chief justice. lincoln believed chase was an able jurist, would support reconstruction legislation, and that his appointment united the republican party.

lincoln appointed 32 federal judges, including four associate justices and one chief justice to the supreme court of the united states, and 27 judges to the united states district courts. lincoln appointed no judges to the united states circuit courts during his time in office.

west virginia was admitted to the union on june 20, 1863. nevada, which became the third state in the far-west of the continent, was admitted as a free state on october 31, 1864.
abraham lincoln was assassinated by john wilkes booth on good friday, april 14, 1865, while attending a play at ford's theatre, five days after lee's surrender. booth was a well-known actor and a confederate spy from maryland; though he never joined the confederate army, he had contacts with the confederate secret service. after attending an april 11, 1865, speech in which lincoln promoted voting rights for blacks, booth decided to assassinate the president. learning of lincoln's intent to attend the play with grant, booth and his co-conspirators planned to assassinate lincoln and grant at the theater and to kill vice president johnson and secretary of state seward at their respective homes. lincoln left to attend the play ""our american cousin"" on april 14. at the last minute, grant decided to go to new jersey to visit his children instead of attending the play.

booth crept up from behind and at about 10:13â pm, fired at the back of lincoln's head, mortally wounding him. lincoln's guest major henry rathbone momentarily grappled with booth, but booth stabbed him and escaped.

lincoln was taken across the street to petersen house. after remaining in a coma for nine hours, lincoln died at 7:22â am on april 15. after death his face relaxed into a smile. stanton saluted and said, ""now he belongs to the ages.""

lincoln's flag-enfolded body was then escorted in the rain to the white house by bareheaded union officers, while the city's church bells rang. president johnson was sworn in at 10:00â am, less than 3 hours after lincoln's death.

booth was tracked to a farm in virginia. refusing to surrender, he was shot on april 26.

the late president lay in state, first in the east room, and then in the capitol rotunda from april 19 through april 21. the caskets containing lincoln's body and the body of his son willie traveled for three weeks on the ""lincoln special"" funeral train. the train followed a circuitous route from washington d.c. to springfield, illinois, stopping at many cities for memorials attended by hundreds of thousands. many others gathered along the tracks as the train passed with bands, bonfires, and hymn singing or in silent grief. poet walt whitman composed ""when lilacs last in the dooryard bloom'd"" to eulogize him, one of four poems he wrote about lincoln. african-americans were especially moved; they had lost 'their moses'. in a larger sense, the reaction was in response to the deaths of so many men in the war. historians emphasized the widespread shock and sorrow, but noted that some lincoln haters celebrated his death.

as a young man, lincoln was a religious skeptic. later in life, lincoln's frequent use of religious imagery and language might have reflected his own personal beliefs or might have been a device to reach his audiences, who were mostly evangelical protestants. he never joined a church, although he frequently attended with his wife. he was deeply familiar with the bible, and he both quoted and praised it. he was private about his beliefs and respected the beliefs of others. lincoln never made a clear profession of christian beliefs. however, he did believe in an all-powerful god that shaped events and by 1865 was expressing those beliefs in major speeches.

in the 1840s, lincoln subscribed to the doctrine of necessity, a belief that asserted the human mind was controlled by some higher power. in the 1850s, lincoln asserted his belief in ""providence"" in a general way, and rarely used the language or imagery of the evangelicals; he regarded the republicanism of the founding fathers with an almost religious reverence. with the death of his son edward, lincoln more frequently expressed a need to depend on god. the death of son willie in february 1862 may have caused lincoln to look toward religion for solace. after willie's death, lincoln considered why, from a divine standpoint, the severity of the war was necessary. he wrote at this time that god ""could have either saved or destroyed the union without a human contest. yet the contest began. and having begun, he could give the final victory to either side any day. yet the contest proceeds."" on the day lincoln was assassinated, he reportedly told his wife he desired to visit the holy land.

several claims have been made that lincoln's health was declining before the assassination. these are often based on photographs appearing to show weight loss and muscle wasting. one such claim is that he suffered from a rare genetic disorder, men2b, which manifests with a medullary thyroid carcinoma, mucosal neuromas and a marfanoid appearance. others simply claim he had marfan syndrome, based on his tall appearance with spindly fingers, and the association of possible aortic regurgitation, which can cause bobbing of the head (demusset's sign)â â based on blurring of lincoln's head in photographs, which required long exposure times. confirmation of this and other diseases could possibly be obtained via dna analysis of a pillow case stained with lincoln's blood, currently in possession of the grand army of the republic museum & library in philadelphia, but as of 2009, the museum refused to provide a sample for testing.

the successful reunification of the states had consequences for the name of the country. the term ""the united states"" has historically been used, sometimes in the plural (""these united states""), and other times in the singular, without any particular grammatical consistency. the civil war was a significant force in the eventual dominance of the singular usage by the end of the 19th century.

historians such as harry jaffa, herman belz, john diggins, vernon burton, and eric foner stress lincoln's redefinition of ""republican values"". as early as the 1850s, a time when most political rhetoric focused on the constitution, lincoln redirected emphasis to the declaration of independence as the foundation of american political valuesâwhat he called the ""sheet anchor"" of republicanism. the declaration's emphasis on equality and freedom for all, in contrast to the constitution's tolerance of slavery, shifted the debate. regarding the 1860 cooper union speech, diggins notes, ""lincoln presented americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself."" he highlights the moral basis of republicanism, rather than its legalisms. nevertheless, lincoln justified the war via legalisms (the constitution was a contract, and for one party to get out of a contract all the other parties had to agree), and then in terms of the national duty to guarantee a republican form of government in every state. burton argues that lincoln's republicanism was taken up by the emancipated freedmen.

in lincoln's first inaugural address, he explored the nature of democracy. he denounced secession as anarchy, and explained that majority rule had to be balanced by constitutional restraints. he said ""a majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations, and always changing easily with deliberate changes of popular opinions and sentiments, is the only true sovereign of a free people.""

in surveys of u.s. scholars ranking presidents conducted since the 1940s, lincoln is consistently ranked in the top three, often as number one. a 2004 study found that scholars in the fields of history and politics ranked lincoln number one, while legal scholars placed him second after george washington. in presidential ranking polls conducted in the united states since 1948, lincoln has been rated at the top in the majority of polls. generally, the top three presidents are rated as 1. lincoln; 2. washington; and 3. franklin delano roosevelt, although the order varies.

president lincoln's assassination left him a national martyr. he was viewed by abolitionists as a champion for human liberty. republicans linked lincoln's name to their party. many, though not all, in the south considered lincoln as a man of outstanding ability. historians have said he was ""a classical liberal"" in the 19th century sense. allen c. guelzo states that lincoln was a
lincoln became a favorite exemplar for liberal intellectuals across the world.

schwartz argues that lincoln's american reputation grew slowly from the late 19th century until the progressive era (1900â1920s) when he emerged as one of america's most venerated heroes, even among white southerners. the high point came in 1922 with the dedication of the lincoln memorial on the national mall in washington, d.c. in the new deal era, liberals honored lincoln not so much as the self-made man or the great war president, but as the advocate of the common man who they claimed would have supported the welfare state. in the cold war years, lincoln's image shifted to a symbol of freedom who brought hope to those oppressed by communist regimes.

by the 1970s, lincoln had become a hero to political conservatives for his intense nationalism, support for business, his insistence on stopping the spread of human bondage, his acting in terms of lockean and burkean principles on behalf of both liberty and tradition, and his devotion to the principles of the founding fathers. as a whig activist, lincoln was a spokesman for business interests, favoring high tariffs, banks, infrastructure improvements, and railroads, in opposition to the agrarian democrats. william c. harris found that lincoln's ""reverence for the founding fathers, the constitution, the laws under it, and the preservation of the republic and its institutions strengthened his conservatism"". james g. randall emphasizes his tolerance and moderation ""in his preference for orderly progress, his distrust of dangerous agitation, and his reluctance toward ill digested schemes of reform"". randall concludes that, ""he was conservative in his complete avoidance of that type of so-called 'radicalism' which involved abuse of the south, hatred for the slaveholder, thirst for vengeance, partisan plotting, and ungenerous demands that southern institutions be transformed overnight by outsiders.""

by the late 1960s, some african american intellectuals, led by lerone bennett jr., rejected lincoln's role as the great emancipator. bennett won wide attention when he called lincoln a white supremacist in 1968. he noted that lincoln used ethnic slurs and told jokes that ridiculed blacks. bennett argued that lincoln opposed social equality, and proposed sending freed slaves to another country. defenders, such as authors dirck and cashin, retorted that he was not as bad as most politicians of his day; and that he was a ""moral visionary"" who deftly advanced the abolitionist cause, as fast as politically possible. the emphasis shifted away from lincoln the emancipator to an argument that blacks had freed themselves from slavery, or at least were responsible for pressuring the government on emancipation. historian barry schwartz wrote in 2009 that lincoln's image suffered ""erosion, fading prestige, benign ridicule"" in the late 20th century. on the other hand, donald opined in his 1996 biography that lincoln was distinctly endowed with the personality trait of negative capability, defined by the poet john keats and attributed to extraordinary leaders who were ""content in the midst of uncertainties and doubts, and not compelled toward fact or reason"". in the 21st century, president barack obama named lincoln his favorite president and insisted on using lincoln's bible for his inaugural ceremonies.

lincoln has often been portrayed by hollywood, almost always in a flattering light.

union nationalism, as envisioned by lincoln, ""helped lead america to the nationalism of theodore roosevelt, woodrow wilson, and franklin delano roosevelt.""

lincoln's portrait appears on two denominations of united states currency, the penny and the $5 bill. his likeness also appears on many postage stamps and he has been memorialized in many town, city, and county names, including the capital of nebraska. while he is usually portrayed bearded, he first grew a beard in 1860 at the suggestion of 11-year-old grace bedell.

the most famous and most visited memorials are lincoln's sculpture on mount rushmore; lincoln memorial, ford's theatre, and petersen house (where he died) in washington, d.c.; and the abraham lincoln presidential library and museum in springfield, illinois, not far from lincoln's home, as well as his tomb.

sociologist barry schwartz argues that in the 1930s and 1940s, the memory of abraham lincoln was practically sacred and provided the nation with ""a moral symbol inspiring and guiding american life"". during the great depression, he argues, lincoln served ""as a means for seeing the world's disappointments, for making its sufferings not so much explicable as meaningful"". franklin d. roosevelt, preparing america for war, used the words of the civil war president to clarify the threat posed by germany and japan. americans asked, ""what would lincoln do?"" however, schwartz also finds that since world war ii, lincoln's symbolic power has lost relevance, and this ""fading hero is symptomatic of fading confidence in national greatness"". he suggested that postmodernism and multiculturalism have diluted greatness as a concept.

the united states navy is named after lincoln, the second navy ship to bear his name.

atal bihari vajpayee,"
atal bihari vajpayee (; 25 december 1924 â 16 august 2018) was an indian politician, statesman and a poet who served three terms as the prime minister of india, first for a term of 13 days in 1996, then for a period of 13 months from 1998 to 1999, and finally, for a full term from 1999 to 2004. a member of the bharatiya janata party (bjp), he was the first indian prime minister who was not a member of the indian national congress party to have served a full five-year term in office.

he was a member of the indian parliament for over five decades, having been elected to the lok sabha, the lower house, ten times, and twice to the rajya sabha, the upper house. he served as the member of parliament for lucknow until 2009 when he retired from active politics due to health concerns. vajpayee was among the founding members of the bharatiya jana sangh (bjs), of which he was the president from 1968 to 1972. the bjs merged with several other parties to form the janata party, which won the 1977 general election. vajpayee became the minister of external affairs in the cabinet of prime minister morarji desai. he resigned in 1979, and the janata alliance collapsed soon after. the erstwhile members of the bjs formed the bjp in 1980, with vajpayee as its first president.

during his tenure as prime minister, india carried out the pokhran-ii nuclear tests in 1998. vajpayee sought to improve diplomatic relations with pakistan, travelling to lahore by bus to meet with prime minister nawaz sharif. after the 1999 kargil war with pakistan, he sought to restore relations through engaging with president pervez musharraf, inviting him to india for a summit at agra.

he was conferred india's highest civilian honour, the bharat ratna, by the president of india, pranab mukherjee in 2015. the administration of narendra modi declared in 2014 that vajpayee's birthday, 25 december, would be marked as good governance day. he died on 16 august 2018 due to an age-related illness.

vajpayee was born to krishna devi and krishna bihari vajpayee in a brahmin family on 25 december 1924 in gwalior. his grandfather, pandit shyam lal vajpayee, had migrated to morena, gwalior from his ancestral village of bateshwar, uttar pradesh. his father, krishna bihari vajpayee, was a school teacher in his hometown. vajpayee did his schooling at the saraswati shishu mandir in gwalior. in 1934, atal bihari was admitted to avm school barnagar district ujjain after his father joined as headmaster. he spoke about his 'lifechanging moment' at a public rally on the 1996 lok sabha election trail. he said ""but i learned a lesson that changed my life. i took a pledge iâd never rote-learn a speech. it was my first speech at avm (anglo vernacular middle) school,"".
he subsequently attended gwalior's victoria college (now maharani laxmi bai govt. college of excellence) for ba in hindi, english and sanskrit. he completed his post-graduation with an ma in political science from dav college, kanpur.

his activism started with arya kumar sabha of gwalior, the youth wing of the arya samaj, of which he became the general secretary in 1944. he also joined the rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (rss) as a ""swayamsevak"", or volunteer, in 1939. influenced by babasaheb apte, he attended the officers training camp of the rss during 1940â44 and became a ""pracharak"", rss terminology for a full-time worker, in 1947. he gave up studying law due to the partition riots. he was sent as a ""vistarak"", a probationary ""pracharak"", to uttar pradesh and quickly began working for the newspapers of deendayal upadhyaya, ""rashtradharma"" (a hindi monthly), ""panchjanya"" (a hindi weekly) and the dailies ""swadesh"" and ""veer arjun"".

by 1942, at the age of 16 years, vajpayee became an active member of the rashtriya swayamsevak sangh. in august 1942, he and his elder brother prem were arrested for 24 days during the quit india movement. he was released after giving a written undertaking stating that while he was a part of the crowd, he did not participate in the militant events in bateshwar on 27 august 1942.

in 1951, vajpayee was seconded by the rss, along with deendayal upadhyaya, to work for the newly formed bharatiya jana sangh, a hindu right-wing political party associated with the rss. he was appointed as a national secretary of the party in charge of the northern region, based in delhi. he soon became a follower and aide of party leader syama prasad mukherjee. in 1954, vajpayee was with mukherjee when the latter went on a hunger strike in kashmir to protest the perceived inferior treatment of non-kashmiri indian visitors to the state. mookerjee died in prison during this strike. in the 1957 indian general election, vajpayee contested elections to the lok sabha, the lower house of indian parliament. he lost to raja mahendra pratap in mathura, but was elected from balrampur. in the lok sabha his oratorial skills so impressed prime minister jawaharlal nehru that he predicted that vajpayee would someday become the prime minister of india.

vajpayee's oratorial skills won him the reputation of being the most eloquent defender of the jana sangh's policies. after the death of deendayal upadhyaya, the leadership of the jana sangh passed to vajpayee. he became the national president of the jana sangh in 1968, running the party along with nanaji deshmukh, balraj madhok, and l. k. advani.

in 1975, vajpayee was arrested along with several other opposition leaders during the internal emergency imposed by prime minister indira gandhi of the indian national congress party. initially interned in bangalore, vajpayee appealed his imprisonment on the grounds of bad health, and was moved to a hospital in delhi. gandhi ended the state of emergency in 1977. a coalition of parties, including the bjs, came together to form the janata party, which won the subsequent general elections. morarji desai, the chosen leader of the alliance, became the prime minister. vajpayee served as the minister of external affairs, or foreign minister, in desai's cabinet. as foreign minister, vajpayee became the first person in 1977 to deliver a speech to the united nations general assembly in hindi.

vajpayee resigned from his post in 1979. the janata party collapsed soon after desai resigned as prime minister in 1979. the erstwhile members of the bharatiya jana sangh came together to form the bharatiya janata party (bjp) in 1980, with vajpayee as its first president.

the 1984 general elections were held in the wake of prime minister indira gandhi's assassination by her sikh bodyguards. while he had won the 1977 and the 1980 elections from new delhi, vajpayee shifted to his home town gwalior for the election. vidya razdan was initially tipped to be the congress (i) candidate. instead, madhavrao scindia, scion of the gwalior royal family, was brought in on the last day of filing nominations. vajpayee lost to scindia, managing to secure only 29% of the votes.

under vajpayee, the bjp moderated the hindu-nationalist position of the jana sangh, emphasising its connection to the janata party and expressing support for gandhian socialism. the ideological shift did not bring it success: gandhi's assassination generated sympathy for the congress, leading to a massive victory at the polls. the bjp won only two seats in parliament. vajpayee offered to quit as party president following bjp's dismal performance in the election, but stayed in the post until 1986. he was elected to the rajya sabha in 1986 from madhya pradesh, and was briefly the leader of the bjp in parliament.

in 1986 l. k. advani took office as president of the bjp. under him, the bjp returned to a policy of hardline hindu nationalism. it became the political voice of the ram janmabhoomi mandir movement, which sought to build a temple dedicated to the hindu deity rama in ayodhya. the temple would be built at a site believed to be the birthplace of rama after demolishing a 16th-century mosque, called the babri masjid, which then stood there. the strategy paid off for the bjp; it won 86 seats in the lok sabha in the 1989 general election, making its support crucial to the government of v. p. singh. in december 1992, a group of religious volunteers led by members of the bjp, the rashtriya swayamsevak sangh (rss) and the vishwa hindu parishad (vhp), tore down the mosque. the bjp's role in the movement led to major political gains.

during a bjp conference in mumbai in november 1995, bjp president advani declared that vajpayee would be the party's prime ministerial candidate in the forthcoming elections. vajpayee himself was reported to be unhappy with the announcement, responding by saying that the party needed to win the election first. the bjp became the single largest party in parliament in the 1996 general election, helped by religious polarisation across the country as a result of the demolition of the babri masjid. indian president shankar dayal sharma invited vajpayee to form the government. vajpayee was sworn in as the 10th prime minister of india, but the bjp failed to muster a majority among members of the lok sabha. vajpayee resigned after 16 days when it became clear that he did not have enough support to form a government.

after the fall of the two united front governments between 1996 and 1998, the lok sabha was dissolved and fresh elections were held. the 1998 general elections again put the bjp ahead of others. a number of political parties joined the bjp to form the national democratic alliance (nda), and vajpayee was sworn in as the prime minister. the coalition was an uneasy one, as apart from the shiv sena, none of the other parties espoused the bjp's hindu-nationalist ideology. vajpayee has been credited for managing this coalition successfully, while facing ideological pressure from the hardline wing of the party and from the rss. vajpayee's government lasted 13 months until mid-1999 when the all india anna dravida munnetra kazhagam (aiadmk) under jayalalithaa withdrew its support. the government lost the ensuing vote of confidence motion in the lok sabha by a single vote on 17 april 1999. as the opposition was unable to come up with the numbers to form the new government, the lok sabha was again dissolved and fresh elections were held.

in may 1998, india conducted five underground nuclear tests in the pokhran desert in rajasthan, 24 years after its first nuclear test (smiling buddha) in 1974. two weeks later, pakistan responded with its own nuclear tests making it the newest nation with declared nuclear capability. while some nations, such as france, endorsed india's right to defensive nuclear power, others including the united states, canada, japan, britain and the european union imposed sanctions on information, resources and technology to india. in spite of intense international criticism and steady decline in foreign investment and trade, the nuclear tests were popular domestically. in effect, the international sanctions imposed failed to sway india from weaponising its nuclear capability. us sanctions against india and pakistan were eventually lifted after just six months.

in late 1998 and early 1999, vajpayee began a push for a full-scale diplomatic peace process with pakistan. with the historic inauguration of the delhi-lahore bus service in february 1999, vajpayee initiated a new peace process aimed towards permanently resolving the kashmir dispute and other conflicts with pakistan. the resultant lahore declaration espoused a commitment to dialogue, expanded trade relations and mutual friendship and envisaged a goal of denuclearised south asia. this eased the tension created by the 1998 nuclear tests, not only within the two nations but also in south asia and the rest of the world.

the vajpayee-led government was faced with two crises in mid-1999. the aiadmk had continually threatened to withdraw from the coalition and national leaders repeatedly flew down from delhi to chennai to pacify the aiadmk chief j. jayalalitha. however, in may 1999, the aiadmk did pull the plug on the nda, and the vajpayee administration was reduced to a caretaker status pending fresh elections scheduled for october 1999.

in may 1999 some kashmiri shepherds discovered the presence of militants and non-uniformed pakistani soldiers (many with official identifications and pakistan army's custom weaponry) in the kashmir valley, where they had taken control of border hilltops and unmanned border posts. the incursion was centred around the town of kargil, but also included the batalik and akhnoor sectors and artillery exchanges at the siachen glacier.

the indian army responded with operation vijay, which launched on 26 may 1999. this saw the indian military fighting thousands of militants and soldiers in the midst of heavy artillery shelling and while facing extremely cold weather, snow and treacherous terrain at the high altitude. over 500 indian soldiers were killed in the three-month-long kargil war, and it is estimated around 600-4,000 pakistani militants and soldiers died as well. india pushed back the pakistani militants and northern light infantry soldiers. almost 70% of the territory was recaptured by india. vajpayee sent a ""secret letter"" to u.s. president bill clinton that if pakistani infiltrators did not withdraw from the indian territory, ""we will get them out, one way or the other""â - meaning he did not rule out crossing the line of control (loc), or was the use of nuclear weapons.

after pakistan suffered heavy losses, and with both the united states and china refusing to condone the incursion or threaten india to stop its military operations, general musharraf was recalcitrant and nawaz sharif asked the remaining militants to stop and withdraw to positions along the loc. the militants were not willing to accept orders from sharif but the nli soldiers withdrew. the militants were killed by the army or forced to withdraw in skirmishes which went beyond the announcement of withdrawal by pakistan.

in the 1999 general elections, the bjp-led nda won 303 seats out of the 543 seats in the lok sabha, in the aftermath of the kargil operations, thereby securing a comfortable and stable majority. on 13 october 1999, vajpayee took oath as prime minister of india for the third time.

a national crisis emerged in december 1999, when indian airlines flight ic 814 from kathmandu to new delhi was hijacked by five terrorists and flown to taliban-ruled afghanistan. the hijackers made several demands including the release of certain terrorists like masood azhar from prison. under extreme pressure, the government ultimately caved in. jaswant singh, the minister of external affairs at the time, flew with the terrorists to afghanistan and exchanged them for the passengers.

in march 2000, bill clinton, the president of the united states, paid a state visit to india. this was the first state visit to india by a u.s. president in 22 years since president jimmy carter's visit in 1978. president clinton's visit was hailed as a significant milestone in relations between the two nations. vajpayee and clinton had wide-ranging discussions on bilateral, regional and international developments. the visit led to expansion in trade and economic ties between india and the united states. a vision document on the future course of indo-u.s. relations was signed during the visit.

domestically, the bjp-led government was under constant pressure from its ideological mentor, the rss, and the hard-line vhp to enact the hindutva agenda. but owing to its dependence on coalition support, it was impossible for the bjp to push items like building the ram janmabhoomi temple in ayodhya, repealing article 370 which gave a special status to the state of kashmir, or enacting a uniform civil code applicable to adherents of all religions. on 17 january 2000, there were reports of the rss and some bjp hard-liners threatening to restart the jan sangh, the precursor to the bjp, because of their discontent over vajpayee's rule. former president of the jan sangh balraj madhok had written a letter to the then-rss chief rajendra singh for support. the bjp was, however, accused of ""saffronising"" the official state education curriculum and apparatus, saffron being the colour of the rss flag of the rss, and a symbol of the hindu nationalism movement. home minister l. k. advani and human resource development minister murli manohar joshi were indicted in the 1992 babri mosque demolition case for inciting a mob of activists. vajpayee himself came under public scrutiny owing to his controversial speech one day prior to the mosque demolition.
these years were accompanied by infighting in the administration and confusion regarding the direction of government. vajpayee's weakening health was also a subject of public interest, and he underwent a major knee-replacement surgery at the breach candy hospital in mumbai to relieve intense pressure upon his legs.

in march 2001, the tehelka group released a sting operation video named operation west end which showed bjp president bangaru laxman, senior army officers and nda members accepting bribes from journalists posing as agents and businessmen. the defence minister george fernandes was forced to resign following the barak missile scandal involving the botched supplies of coffins for the soldiers killed in kargil, and the findings of an inquiry commission that the government could have prevented the kargil invasion.

vajpayee initiated talks with pakistan, and invited pakistani president pervez musharraf to agra for a joint summit, the agra summit. president musharraf was believed in india to be the principal architect of the kargil war. by accepting him as the president of pakistan, vajpayee chose to move forward. but after three days of much fanfare, which included musharraf visiting his birthplace in delhi, the summit failed to achieve a breakthrough as president musharraf declined to leave aside the issue of kashmir.

on 13 december 2001, a group of masked, armed men with fake ids stormed the parliament house in delhi. the terrorists managed to kill several security guards, but the building was sealed off swiftly and security forces cornered and killed the men who were later proven to be pakistan nationals. vajpayee ordered indian troops to mobilise for war, leading to an estimated 500,000 to 750,000 indian soldiers positioned along the international border between india and pakistan. pakistan responded by mobilising its own troops along the border. a terrorist attack on an army garrison in kashmir in may 2002 further escalated the situation. as the threat of war between two nuclear capable countries, and the consequent possibility of a nuclear exchange, loomed large, international diplomatic mediation focused on defusing the situation. in october 2002, both india and pakistan announced that they would withdraw their troops from the border.

the vajpayee administration brought in the prevention of terrorism act in 2002. the act was aimed at curbing terrorist threats by strengthening powers of government authorities to investigate and act against suspects. it was passed in a joint session of the parliament, amidst concerns that the law would be misused.

but the biggest political disaster hit his government between december 2001 and march 2002: the vhp held the government hostage in a major standoff in ayodhya over the ram temple. at the 10th anniversary of the destruction of the babri mosque, the vhp wanted to perform a ""shila daan"", or a ceremony laying the foundation stone of the cherished temple at the disputed site. thousands of vhp activists amassed and threatened to overrun the site and forcibly perform the ""shila daan"". a grave threat of not only communal violence, but an outright breakdown of law and order owing to the defiance of the government by a religious organisation hung over the nation. but to the relief of vajpayee, the incident ended peacefully with a symbolic handover of a stone at a different location 1â km away from the disputed site.

in february 2002, a train filled with hindu pilgrims returning to gujarat from ayodhya stopped in the town of godhra. a scuffle broke out between hindu activists and muslim residents, and amidst uncertain circumstance, the train was set on fire leading to the deaths of 59 people. the charred bodies of the victims were displayed in public in the city of ahmedabad, and the vishwa hindu parishad called for a statewide strike in gujarat. these decisions stoked anti-muslim sentiments. blaming muslims for the deaths, rampaging hindu mobs killed thousands of muslim men and women, destroying muslim homes and places of worship. the violence raged for more than two months, and more than 1,000 people died. gujarat was being ruled by a bjp government, with narendra modi as the chief minister. the state government was criticised for mishandling the situation. it was accused of doing little to stop the violence, and even being complicit in encouraging it.

vajpayee reportedly wanted to remove modi, but was eventually prevailed upon by party members to not act against him. he traveled to gujarat, visiting godhra, and ahmedabad, the site of the most violent riots. he announced financial aid for victims, and urged an end to the violence. while he condemned the violence, he did not chastise modi directly in public. when asked as to what would be his message to the chief minister in the event of the riots having taking place, vajpayee responded that modi must follow ""raj dharma"", hindi for ethical governance.

at the meeting of the bjp national executive in goa in april 2002, vajpayee's speech generated controversy for its contents which included him saying: ""wherever muslims live, they donât like to live in co-existence with others."" the prime minister's office stated that these remarks had been taken out of context. vajpayee was accused of doing nothing to stop the violence, and later admitted mistakes in handling the events. k. r. narayanan, then president of india, also blamed vajpayee's government for failing to quell the violence. after the bjp's defeat in the 2004 general elections, vajpayee admitted that not removing modi had been a mistake.

in late 2002 and 2003 the government pushed through economic reforms. the country's gdp growth exceeded 7% every year from 2003 to 2007, following three years of sub-5% growth. increasing foreign investment, modernisation of public and industrial infrastructure, the creation of jobs, a rising high-tech and it industry and urban modernisation and expansion improved the nation's international image. good crop harvests and strong industrial expansion also helped the economy.

the government reformed the tax system, increased the pace of reforms and pro-business initiatives, major irrigation and housing schemes and so on. the political energies of the bjp shifted to the rising urban middle-class and young people, who were positive and enthusiastic about the major economic expansion and future of the country. he faced stiff opposition from other equally strong organisations in the sangh parivar such as the bharatiya mazdoor sangh and the bharatiya kisan sangh. however, he continued with his aggressive economic reform policy.

in may 2003, he announced before the parliament that he would make one last effort to achieve peace with pakistan. the announcement ended a period of 16 months, following the 2001 attack on the indian parliament, during which india had severed diplomatic ties with pakistan. although diplomatic relations did not pick up immediately, visits were exchanged by high-level officials and the military standoff ended. the pakistani president and pakistani politicians, civil and religious leaders hailed this initiative as did the leaders of the united states, europe and much of the world. in july 2003, prime minister vajpayee visited china, and met with various chinese leaders. he recognised tibet as a part of china, which was welcomed by the chinese leadership, and which, in the following year, recognised sikkim, as part of india. chinaâindia relations improved greatly in the following years.

vajpayee's government introduced many domestic economic and infrastructural reforms, including encouraging the private sector and foreign investments, reducing governmental waste, encouraging research and development and privatisation of some government owned corporations. among vajpayee's projects were the national highways development project and pradhan mantri gram sadak yojana. in 2001, the vajpayee government launched the sarva shiksha abhiyan campaign, aimed at improving the quality of education in primary and secondary schools.

in 2003, news reports suggested a tussle within the bjp with regard to sharing of leadership between vajpayee and deputy prime lk advani. bjp president venkaiah naidu had suggested that advani must lead the party politically at the 2004 general elections, referring to vajpayee as ""vikas purush"", hindi for development man, and advani as ""loh purush"", iron man. when vajpayee subsequently threatened retirement, naidu backtracked announcing that the party would contest the elections under the twin leadership of vajpayee and advani.

the nda was widely expected to retain power after the 2004 general election. it announced elections six months ahead of schedule, hoping to capitalise on economic growth, and vajpayee's peace initiative with pakistan. the 13th lok sabha was dissolved before the completion of its term. the bjp hoped to capitalise on a perceived 'feel-good factor' and bjp's recent successes in the assembly elections in rajasthan, madhya pradesh and chhattisgarh. under the ""india shining"" campaign, it released ads proclaiming the economic growth of the nation under the government.

however, the bjp could only win 138 seats in the 543-seat parliament, with several prominent cabinet ministers being defeated. the nda coalition won 185 seats. the indian national congress, led by sonia gandhi, emerged as the single largest party, wining 145 seats in the election. the congress and its allies, comprising many smaller parties, formed the united progressive alliance, accounting for 220 seats in the parliament. vajpayee resigned as prime minister. the upa, with the outside support of communist parties, formed the next government with manmohan singh as the prime minister.

in december 2005, vajpayee announced his retirement from active politics, declaring that he would not contest in the next general election. in a famous statement at the bjp's silver jubilee rally at mumbai's shivaji park, vajpayee announced that ""henceforth, lal krishna advani and pramod mahajan will be the ram-lakshman [the two godly brothers much revered and worshipped by hindus] of the bjp.""

vajpayee was referred to as the ""bhishma pitamah"" of indian politics by former prime minister manmohan singh during a speech in the rajya sabha, a reference to the character in the hindu epic mahabharata who was held in respect by two warring sides.

vajpayee was hospitalised at all india institute of medical sciences, delhi (aiims) for a chest infection and fever on 6 february 2009. he was put on ventilator support as his condition worsened but he eventually recuperated and was later discharged. unable to participate in the campaign for the 2009 general election due to his poor health, he wrote a letter urging voters to back the bjp. his protege lalji tandon was able to retain the lucknow seat in that election even though the nda suffered electoral reverses all over the country. it was speculated that vajpayee's non-partisan appeal contributed to lalji's success in lucknow in contrast to that bjp's poor performance elsewhere in uttar pradesh.

vajpayee remained a bachelor his entire life. he adopted and raised namita bhattacharya as his own child, the daughter of longtime friend rajkumari kaul and bn kaul. his adopted family lived with him.

unlike purist brahmins who shun meat and alcohol, vajpayee was known to be fond of whisky and meat. he was a noted poet, writing in hindi. his published works include ""kaidi kavirai ki kundalian"", a collection of poems written when he was imprisoned during the 1975â77 emergency, and ""amar aag hai"". with regard to his poetry he wrote, ""my poetry is a declaration of war, not an exordium to defeat. it is not the defeated soldier's drumbeat of despair, but the fighting warrior's will to win. it is not the despirited voice of dejection but the stirring shout of victory.""

vajpayee suffered a stroke in 2009 which impaired his speech. his health had been a major source of concern; reports said he was confined to a wheelchair and failed to recognise people. he also suffered from dementia and long-term diabetes. for many years, he had not attended any public engagements and rarely ventured out of the house, except for checkups at the all india institutes of medical sciences.

on 11 june 2018, vajpayee was admitted to aiims in critical condition following a kidney infection. he was officially declared dead there at 5:05â pm ist on 16 august 2018 at the age of 93. however some sources claim that he had died on the previous day. on the morning of 17 august, vajpayee's body draped with the indian flag was taken to the bharatiya janata party headquarters where party workers paid their tributes until 1â pm. later that afternoon at 4â pm, vajpayee was cremated with full state honours at rashtriya smriti sthal near raj ghat, his pyre was lit by his foster daughter namita kaul bhattacharya. thousands of people and many dignitaries attended his funeral procession including prime minister narendra modi and president ram nath kovind. on 19 august, his ashes were immersed in ganga river at haridwar by his daughter namita.

india reacted to vajpayee's death with grief and thousands of tributes poured in through social media platforms. thousands of people paid their respects during his funeral procession. a seven-day state mourning was announced by the central government throughout india. the national flag flew half-mast during this period.




vajpayee authored several works of both prose and poetry. some of his major publications are listed below. in addition to these, various collections were made of his speeches, articles, and slogans.



an english translation of a selection of some of vajpayee's hindi poetry was published in 2013.

justin pierre james trudeau (; ; born december 25, 1971) is a canadian politician serving as the 23rd and current prime minister of canada since 2015 and leader of the liberal party since 2013. trudeau is the second-youngest canadian prime minister after joe clark; he is also the first to be related to a previous holder of the post, as the eldest son of pierre trudeau.

born in ottawa, trudeau attended collã¨ge jean-de-brã©beuf, graduated from mcgill university in 1994, and then the university of british columbia in 1998. he has a bachelor of arts degree in literature and a bachelor of education degree. after graduating, he worked as a teacher in vancouver, british columbia. he started studying engineering at montreal's ãcole polytechnique in 2002, but dropped out in 2003. beginning in 2004, he took one year of a masterâs program in environmental geography at mcgill university, but left without graduating in 2005. he has also held jobs including camp counselor, nightclub bouncer, and snowboard instructor.

in the 2008 federal election, he was elected to represent the riding of papineau in the house of commons. in 2009, he was appointed the liberal party's critic for youth and multiculturalism, and the following year, became critic for citizenship and immigration. in 2011, he was appointed as critic for secondary education and sport. trudeau won the leadership of the liberal party in april 2013 and led his party to victory in the 2015 federal election, moving the third-placed liberals from 36 seats to 184 seats, the largest-ever numerical increase by a party in a federal election.

on june 23, 1971, the prime minister's office (pmo) announced that prime minister pierre elliott trudeau's wife of four months, the former margaret sinclair, was pregnant and due in december. justin trudeau was born on christmas day 1971 at 9:27â pm est at the ottawa civic hospital. he is the second child in canadian history to be born to a prime minister in office; the first was john a. macdonald's daughter margaret mary theodora macdonald (february 8, 1869â â january 28, 1933). trudeau's younger brothers alexandre (sacha) (born december 25, 1973) and michel (october 2, 1975â â november 13, 1998) were the third and fourth.

trudeau is predominantly of scottish and french canadian descent. his grandfathers were businessman charles-ãmile trudeau and scottish-born james sinclair, who served as minister of fisheries in the cabinet of prime minister louis st. laurent. trudeau's maternal great-grandfather thomas bernard was born in makassar and immigrated to penticton, british columbia, in 1906 at age 15 with his family. through the bernard family, kinsmen of the earls of bandon, trudeau is the 5th-great grandson of major-general william farquhar, a leader in the founding of modern singapore; trudeau also has remote ethnic malaccan and ono niha ancestry.

trudeau was baptized with his father's niece anne rouleau-danis as godmother and his mother's brother-in-law thomas walker as godfather at ottawa's notre dame basilica on the afternoon of january 16, 1972, which marked his first public appearance. on april 14, 1972, trudeau's father and mother hosted a gala at the national arts centre, at which visiting u.s. president richard m. nixon said, ""i'd like to toast the future prime minister of canada, to justin pierre trudeau"" to which pierre elliott trudeau responded that should his son ever assume the role, he hoped he would have ""the grace and skill of the president"". earlier that same day u.s. first lady pat nixon had come to see him in his nursery to deliver a gift, a stuffed toy snoopy. nixon's white house audio tapes later revealed nixon referred to that visit as ""wasting three days up there. that trip we needed like a hole in the head.""

his parents publicly announced their separation on may 27, 1977, when trudeau was five years old, with his father having custody. there had been repeated rumours of a reconciliation in the public for many years afterwards, but his mother's attorney michael levine filed in toronto to the supreme court of ontario for a no-fault divorce on november 16, 1983, and finalized on april 2, 1984, with his father publicly announcing his intention to retire as prime minister on february 29 of that year. eventually his parents came to an amicable joint-custody arrangement and learned to get along quite well. interviewed in october 1979, his nanny dianne lavergne was quoted, ""justin is a mommy's boy, so it's not easy, but children's hurts mend very quickly. and they're lucky kids, anyway."" of his mother and father's marriage, trudeau said in 2009, ""they loved each other incredibly, passionately, completely. but there was 30 years between them and my mom never was an equal partner in what encompassed my father's life, his duty, his country."" trudeau has three half-siblings, kyle and alicia, from his mother's remarriage to fried kemper, and sarah, from his father's relationship with deborah coyne.

trudeau lived at 24 sussex drive, ottawa, the official residence of canada's prime minister, from his birth until his father's government was defeated in the federal election on may 22, 1979. the trudeaus were expected to move into the residence of the leader of the official opposition, stornoway, at 541 acacia avenue in rockcliffe park, but because of flooding in the basement, prime minister joe clark offered them harrington lake, the prime minister's official country retreat in gatineau park, with the expectation they would move into stornoway at the start of july. however, the repairs were not complete so pierre trudeau took a prolonged vacation with his sons to the nova scotia summer home of his friend, mp don johnston, and later sent his sons to stay with their maternal grandparents in north vancouver for the rest of the summer while he slept at his friend's ottawa apartment. justin and his brothers returned to ottawa for the start of the school year, but lived only on the top floor of stornoway while repairs continued on the bottom floor. his mother purchased and moved into a new home nearby at 95 queen victoria avenue in ottawa's new edinburgh in september 1979. the trudeaus returned to the prime minister's official residence in february 1980 after the election that returned his father to the prime minister's office.

his father had intended trudeau to begin his formal education at a french lycã©e, but trudeau's mother convinced his father of the importance of sending their sons to a public school. in the end, trudeau was enrolled in 1976 in the french immersion program at rockcliffe park public school, the same school his mother had attended for 2 years when her family relocated to rockcliffe park while her father served as a federal cabinet minister. he could have been dropped off by limousine, but his parents elected he take the school bus albeit with a royal canadian mounted police car following. this was followed by one year at the private lycã©e claudel d'ottawa.

after his father's retirement in june 1984, his mother remained at her new edinburgh home while the rest of the family moved into his father's home at 1418 pine avenue, montreal known as cormier house where the following autumn he began attending the private collã¨ge jean-de-brã©beuf, his father's alma mater. the school had begun as a jesuit school but was non-denominational by the time justin matriculated. in 2008, trudeau said that of all his early family outings he enjoyed camping with his father the most, because ""that was where our father got to be just our fatherâ â a dad in the woods"". during the summers his father would send him and his brothers to camp ahmek, on canoe lake, in algonquin provincial park, where he would later work in his first paid employment as a camp counselor.

trudeau and his brothers were given shares in a numbered trust fund by their father, from which they receive regular dividends. as of august 2011, trudeau's company had assets of $1.2 million.

trudeau has a bachelor of arts degree in literature from mcgill university and a bachelor of education degree from the university of british columbia. in his first year at mcgill, trudeau became acquainted with his future principal secretary gerald butts, through their mutual friend, jonathan ablett. butts invited trudeau to join the mcgill debating union. they bonded while driving back to montreal after a debate tournament at princeton university in which the princeton team included ted cruz, a u.s. senator, who was a candidate for the u.s. republican party's presidential nomination in 2016. after graduation, trudeau stayed in vancouver where he became a substitute teacher at local schools and worked permanently as a french and math teacher at the private west point grey academy. he became a roommate at the douglas lodge with fellow west point grey academy faculty member and friend christopher ingvaldson. from 2002 to 2004, he studied engineering at the ãcole polytechnique de montrã©al, a part of the universitã© de montrã©al. he started a master's degree in environmental geography at mcgill, but withdrew from the program to seek public office among other reasons.

in august 2000, justin trudeau attended the kokanee summit in creston, british columbia, to raise funds in honour of his brother michel trudeau and other avalanche victims. after the event, an unsigned editorial in the ""creston valley advance"" (a local newspaper) accused trudeau of having groped an unnamed female reporter while at the music festival. the editorial stated trudeau provided a ""day-late"" apology to the reporter, saying, ""if i had known you were reporting for a national paper, i never would have been so forward"". in 2018, trudeau was questioned about the groping incident but said he did not remember any negative incidents from that time. his apology and later statement about the event have been described as hypocritical, while responses to the story have been described as a witch hunt or non-story.

trudeau, then 28, emerged as a prominent figure in october 2000, after delivering a eulogy at his father's state funeral. the canadian broadcasting corporation (cbc) received numerous calls to rebroadcast the speech after its initial transmission, and leading quebec politician claude ryan described it as ""perhapsâ ... the first manifestation of a dynasty"". a book issued by the cbc in 2003 included the speech in its list of significant canadian events from the past fifty years.

in 2007, trudeau starred in the two-part cbc television miniseries ""the great war"", which gave an account of canada's participation in the first world war. he portrayed his fifth cousin, twice removed, major talbot mercer papineau, who was killed on october 30, 1917, during the battle of passchendaele. trudeau is one of several children of former prime ministers who have become canadian media personalities. the others are ben mulroney (son of brian mulroney), catherine clark (daughter of joe clark), and trudeau's younger brother, alexandre. ben mulroney was a guest at trudeau's wedding.

trudeau and his family started the kokanee glacier alpine campaign for winter sports safety in 2000, two years after his brother michel died in an avalanche during a ski trip. in 2002, trudeau criticized the government of british columbia's decision to stop its funding for a public avalanche warning system.
trudeau chaired the katimavik youth program, a project started by longtime family friend jacques hã©bert, from 2002 to 2006.

in 2002â03, trudeau was a panelist on cbc radio's ""canada reads"" series, where he championed ""the colony of unrequited dreams"" by wayne johnston. trudeau and his brother alexandre inaugurated the trudeau centre for peace and conflict studies at the university of toronto in april 2004; the centre later became a part of the munk school of global affairs. in 2006, he hosted the giller prize for literature.

in 2005, trudeau fought against a proposed $100-million zinc mine that he argued would poison the nahanni river, a united nations world heritage site located in the northwest territories. he was quoted as saying, ""the river is an absolutely magnificent, magical place. i'm not saying mining is wrongâ ... but that is not the place for it. it's just the wrong thing to be doing.""

on september 17, 2006, trudeau was the master of ceremonies at a toronto rally organized by romã©o dallaire that called for canadian participation in resolving the darfur crisis.

trudeau supported the liberal party from a young age, offering his support to party leader john turner in the 1988 federal election. two years later, he defended canadian federalism at a student event at the collã¨ge jean-de-brã©beuf, which he attended.

following his father's death, trudeau became more involved with the liberal party throughout the 2000s. along with olympian charmaine crooks, he co-hosted a tribute to outgoing prime minister jean chrã©tien at the party's 2003 leadership convention, and was appointed to chair a task force on youth renewal after the party's defeat in the 2006 federal election.

in october 2006, trudeau criticized quebec nationalism by describing political nationalism generally as an ""old idea from the 19th century"", ""based on a smallness of thought"" and not relevant to modern quebec. this comment was seen as a criticism of michael ignatieff, then a candidate in the 2006 liberal party leadership election, who was promoting recognition of quebec as a nation. trudeau later wrote a public letter on the subject, describing the idea of quebec nationhood as ""against everything my father ever believed"".

trudeau announced his support for leadership candidate gerard kennedy shortly before the 2006 convention and introduced kennedy during the candidates' final speeches. when kennedy dropped off after the second ballot, trudeau joined him in supporting the ultimate winner, stã©phane dion.

rumours circulated in early 2007 that trudeau would run in an upcoming by-election in the montreal riding of outremont. the montreal newspaper ""la presse"" reported despite trudeau's keenness, liberal leader stã©phane dion wanted outremont for a star candidate who could help rebuild the liberal party. instead, trudeau announced that he would seek the liberal nomination in the nearby riding of papineau for the next general election. the riding, which had once been held for 26 years by andrã© ouellet, a senior minister under his father, had been in liberal hands for 53 years before falling to the bloc quã©bã©cois in 2006.

on april 29, 2007, trudeau won the liberal party's nomination, picking up 690 votes to 350 for deros and 220 for giordano against mary deros, a montreal city councillor and basilio giordano, the publisher of a local italian-language newspaper. 

prime minister stephen harper called an election for october 14, 2008, by which time trudeau had been campaigning for a year in papineau. on election day trudeau narrowly defeated bloc quã©bã©cois incumbent vivian barbot. following his election win, edward greenspon, editor-in-chief of ""the globe and mail"", noted that trudeau would ""be viewed as few other rookie mps areâas a potential future prime ministerâand scrutinized through that lens"".

the conservative party won a minority government in the 2008 election, and trudeau entered parliament as a member of the official opposition. trudeau was the first member of the 40th parliament of canada to introduce a private member's motion, in which he called for a ""national voluntary service policy for young people"". the proposal won support from parliamentarians across party lines. he later co-chaired the liberal party's april 2009 national convention in vancouver, and in october of the same year he was appointed as the party's critic for multiculturalism and youth.

in september 2010, he was reassigned as critic for youth, citizenship, and immigration. during that time, he criticized the government's legislation targeting human smuggling, which he argued would penalize the victims of smuggling.

trudeau sparked controversy when it was revealed that he earned $1.3 million in public speaking fees from charities and school boards across canada, $277,000 of which trudeau received after becoming an mp.

he encouraged an increase of canada's relief efforts after the 2010 haiti earthquake, and sought more accessible immigration procedures for haitians moving to canada in the time of crisis. his own riding includes a significant haitian community.

trudeau was re-elected in papineau in the 2011 federal election, as the liberal party fell to third-party standing in the house of commons with only thirty-four seats. ignatieff resigned as party leader immediately after the election, and rumours again circulated that trudeau could run to become his successor. on this occasion, trudeau said, ""i don't feel i should be closing off any optionsâ ... because of the history packaged into my name, a lot of people are turning to me in a way thatâ ... to be blunt, concerns me."" weeks after the election toronto mp bob rae was selected to serve as the interim leader until the party's leadership convention, which was later decided to be held in april 2013. rae appointed trudeau as the party's critic for post secondary education, youth and amateur sport. after his re-election, he traveled the country hosting fundraisers for charities and the liberal party.

trudeau wanted to take part in a charity boxing match on behalf of the cancer research fundraising event fight for the cure, but was having difficulty finding a conservative opponent until conservative senator patrick brazeau agreed when asked on trudeau's behalf by their mutual hairdresser stefania capovilla. the fight on march 31, 2012, in ottawa at the hampton inn was broadcast live on sun news with commentary by ezra levant and brian lilley and trudeau won in the third round, the result considered an upset.

after dion's resignation as liberal leader in 2008, trudeau's name was mentioned as a potential candidate with polls showing him as a favourite among canadians for the position.

however, trudeau did not enter the race and ignatieff was named leader in december 2008. after the party's poor showing in the 2011 election, ignatieff resigned from the leadership and trudeau was again seen as a potential candidate to lead the party.

following the election, trudeau said he was undecided about seeking the leadership; months later on october 12 at wilfrid laurier university, he announced he would not seek the post because he had a young family. when interim leader rae, who was also seen as a frontrunner, announced he would not be entering the race in june 2012, trudeau was hit with a ""tsunami"" of calls from supporters to reconsider his earlier decision to not seek the leadership.

opinion polling conducted by several pollsters showed that if trudeau were to become leader the liberal party would surge in support, from a distant third place to either being competitive with the conservative party or leading them. in july 2012, trudeau stated that he would reconsider his earlier decision to not seek the leadership and would announce his final decision at the end of the summer.

on september 26, 2012, multiple media outlets started reporting that trudeau would launch his leadership bid the following week. while trudeau was seen as a frontrunner for the leadership of the liberal party, he was criticized for his perceived lack of substance. during his time as a member of parliament he spoke little on policy matters and it was not known where he stood on many issues such as the economy and foreign affairs. some strategists and pundits believed the leadership would be the time for trudeau to be tested on these issues; however, there was also fear within the party that his celebrity status and large lead might deter other strong candidates from entering the leadership race.

on october 2, 2012, trudeau held a rally in montreal to launch his bid for the leadership of the liberal party. the core people on his campaign team were considered longtime friends, and all in their 30s and 40s. his senior advisor was gerald butts, the former president of wwf-canada who had previously served as principal secretary to former ontario premier dalton mcguinty. other senior aides included campaign manager katie telford, and policy advisors mike mcneir and robert asselin, who had all worked for recent liberal party leaders. his brother alexandre also took a break from his documentary work to be a senior advisor on trudeau's campaign.

during the leadership campaign three by-elections were held on november 26, 2012. the riding calgary centre was expected to be a three-way race between the conservatives, liberals and green party. a week before by-election day sun media reported on comments trudeau had made in a 2010 interview with tã©lã©-quã©bec, in which he said, ""canada isn't doing well right now because it's albertans who control our community and socio-democratic agenda."" trudeau's campaign advisor said that the comments were being brought up now because of the close race in calgary centre. the following day, trudeau apologized, saying he was wrong to use ""alberta"" as ""shorthand"" in referring to stephen harper's government. the conservatives held onto calgary centre in the by-election by less than 1,200 votes. liberal candidate harvey locke said he lost the by-election on his own and that comments made by trudeau did not influence the outcome.

fellow leadership candidate marc garneau, seen as trudeau's main challenger in the race, criticized trudeau for not releasing enough substantial policy positions. garneau called on him to release more detailed policies before members and supporters begin to vote. garneau later challenged trudeau to a one-on-one debate, and said that if trudeau could not defend his ideas in a debate against him, he wouldn't be able to do so against prime minister harper. trudeau clashed in debates with challenger joyce murray, who was the only liberal leadership candidate to speak out strongly in favour of electing the house of commons with a system of proportional representation. she challenged trudeau over his support for a preferential ballot voting system.

on march 13, 2013, garneau dropped out of the leadership race, saying that polling conducted by his campaign showed he would be unable to defeat trudeau.

with joyce murray the last challenger receiving significant press time, more liberal politicians and public figures declared themselves for trudeau. trudeau was declared the winner of the leadership election on april 14, 2013, garnering 80.1% of 30,800 votes. joyce murray finished in second place with 10.2% points, ahead of martha hall findlay's 5.7%. trudeau had lost only five ridings, all to murray and all in bc.

polls conducted during the leadership race showed that support for the liberals would surge if they were led by trudeau. days after winning his party's leadership a poll showed that the liberal party was the choice of 43 per cent of respondents. this compared to 30 per cent for the governing conservatives and 19 per cent for the official opposition new democrats.

according to an october 2013 ekos poll, trudeau's approval numbers improved to a 48â29 approvalâdisapproval; thomas mulcair's jumped to a slight lead at 50â25, while stephen harper's ratings sank to 24â69.
a december 2013 ekos poll showed the liberals preferred by 32.1% of voters, the conservatives by 26.2%, the ndp 22.9%. likely voters, estimated by removing those who didn't vote in 2011, moved the parties into a logjam: liberals 29.1%, conservatives 28.5%, ndp 27.2%.

in 2013, justin trudeau chose to give up his seat at the funeral of nelson mandela, in deference to irwin cotler as representative of the liberal party of canada, because of cotler's work for and with nelson mandela in fighting apartheid.

during the leadership campaign trudeau pledged to park all his assets, exclusive of real estate holdings, into a blind trust which is atypical for opposition mps, including leaders. according to documents obtained by the ""ottawa citizen"", he fulfilled the pledge in july 2013 when the blind trust was set up by bmo private banking.

on january 27, 2014, trudeau and mp carolyn bennett escorted chrystia freeland into the house of commons, as is traditional for by-election victors. trudeau launched an internet video the week before the 2014 liberal party convention titled ""an economy that benefits us all"" in which he narrates his economic platform. he said that canada's debt to gdp ratios have come down in recent years and now it's time for ottawa to ""step up"".

on october 19, 2015, after the longest official campaign in over a century, trudeau led the liberals to a decisive victory in the federal election. the liberals won 184 of the 338 seats, with 39.5% of the popular vote, for a strong majority government; a gain of 150 seats compared to the 2011 federal election.

this was the second-best performance in the party's history. the liberals won mostly on the strength of a solid performance in the eastern half of the country. in addition to taking all of atlantic canada and toronto, they won 40 seats in quebecâthe most that the liberals had won in that province since trudeau's father led them to a near-sweep of the province in 1980, and also the first time since then that the liberals won a majority of quebec's seats in an election. the 150-seat gain was the biggest numerical increase for a single party since confederation, and marked the first time that a party had rebounded from third place in the commons to a majority government.

in addition to the appeal of his party's platform, trudeau's success has been credited to his performance both on the campaign trail and televised leaders' debates exceeding the lowered expectations created by conservative advertisements and conservative media outlets.

trudeau declared victory shortly after cbc news projected that he had won a majority government. he began his speech with a reference to wilfrid laurier's ""sunny ways"" () approach to bringing canadians together despite their differences. according to trudeau, laurier ""knew that politics can be a positive force, and that's the message canadians have sent today"". harper announced his resignation as the head of the conservative party that night.

trudeau and the rest of the cabinet were sworn in by governor general david johnston on november 4, 2015. he said that his first legislative priority was to lower taxes for middle-income canadians and raise taxes for the top one per cent of income earners after parliament was reconvened on december 3, 2015. trudeau also issued a statement promising to rebuild relations with indigenous people and run an open, ethical and transparent government. on november 5, 2015, during the first liberal caucus meeting since forming a majority government, the party announced that it would reinstate the mandatory long-form census that had been scrapped in 2010, effective with the 2016 census.

in january 2017, canada's ethics commissioner, mary dawson, began an investigation into trudeau for a vacation he and his family took to aga khan iv's private island in the bahamas. the ethics commissioner's report, released in december 2017, found that trudeau had violated four provisions of the conflict of interest act. he became the first sitting prime minister to break federal conflict of interest rules.

in february 2018, trudeau was criticized when his administration invited khalistani nationalist jaspal atwal to the canadian high commission's dinner party in delhi. atwal had previously been convicted for the shooting and attempted murder of indian cabinet minister malkiat singh sidhu in 1986, as well as the assault on former b.c. premier ujjal dosanjh in 1985. following the dinner, the pmo rescinded the invitation, and apologized for the incident.

an publication based on the investigations of 20 respected academics, ""assessing justin trudeau's liberal government: 353 promises and a mandate for change"", found that justin trudeau's liberal government kept 92 percent of pledges, a sum of complete and partial pledges. the harper government kept 85 percent of complete and partial pledges. when only completed, realized pledges were calculated, harper's government, in their last year, kept 77 percent of promises while the liberal government kept 53.5 percent. harper's pledges tended towards transactional pledges which target sub-populations while the liberal government's promises were transformative. trudeau's government, according to the researchers, and the ""last harper government had the highest rates of follow-through on their campaign promises of any canadian government over the last 35 years."" the book's intent was to provide a non-partisan driven view of canadian politicians and governments since despite the fact that canadian politicians have shown to be good at keeping promises canadians tend to be biased, thinking all politicians are liars.

trudeau has stated that he wishes to form a party that is ""resolutely pro-choice"" and that potential liberal candidates in the 2015 election who are anti-abortion would not be greenlighted for the nomination if they did not agree to vote pro-choice on abortion bills. this stance was in line with a resolution passed by a majority of liberal party members at its 2012 policy convention. trudeau's stance was criticized by conservative catholics, with former mp jim karygiannis saying it will ""definitely hurt the party"", and toronto cardinal thomas collins writing to trudeau urging him to reverse his ruling, leading trudeau to defend the position.

during the election, the liberal party promised to run a deficit of around $10â billion per year, but trudeau's minister of finance, bill morneau, announced in his first budget in march 2016 that the government would have a $29â billion deficit in 2016 and 2017.

during the campaign prior to the 2015 federal election, trudeau promised to eliminate the current voting system by the next federal election. called ""first-past-the-post"" or ""single-member plurality"", this system awards the house of commons seat in any electoral district to the candidate who received the most votes in that electoral riding, and the party with the most seats forms government. consequently, it is possible for a political party to form a majority government with around 40 percent of the popular vote across canada.

trudeau has said that he advocates a system where the distribution of seats is more in line with the popular vote on a canada-wide basis, to be achieved by a new type of ballot that allows voters to rank the candidates in order of preference. however, trudeau has said that he is open to proportional representation, which is more likely to produce coalition governments.

in december 2015, the government announced that an all-party parliamentary committee would be formed in early 2016 to consider other options. during a discussion of the plan, minister of democratic institutions maryam monsef referred to it as ""an open and robust process of consultation"". however, she refused to commit to the conservative party's demand for a public referendum that would allow canadians to vote on their preferred electoral system, indicating that she does not want to ""prejudice the outcome of that consultation process"".

there was some controversy regarding the government's initial plans for the special committee on electoral reform, as the liberals announced that they would have a majority of the committee's ten seats. trudeau and monsef subsequently altered their plans, ceding a majority of the seats to the opposition. trudeau acknowledged the opposition's concerns that ""we were perhaps behaving in a way that was resembling more the previous government than the kind of approach and tone that we promised throughout the electoral campaign"", and stated they changed course to show otherwise.

on february 1, 2017, the newly appointed minister of democratic institutions karina gould announced that the government had abandoned the electoral reform project and it was no longer a priority in her mandate letter from trudeau. in the letter, trudeau wrote that ""a clear preference for a new electoral system, let alone a consensus, has not emerged"" and that ""without a clear preference or a clear question, a referendum would not be in canada's interest"".

on february 10, 2017, at a townhall in yellowknife, trudeau admitted he had ""turned his back"" on the promise to reform the electoral system.

in 2017, the liberal government announced canada will welcome nearly one million immigrants over the next three years. the number of migrants will climb to 310,000 in 2018, up from 300,000 in 2017. that number will rise to 330,000 in 2019 then 340,000 in 2020.

trudeau met with hundreds of chiefs at the assembly of first nations on december 7, 2015, and laid out his philosophy and commitments to canada's indigenous people, to assure their ""constitutionally guaranteed rightsâ ... a sacred obligation"". in brief, he promised to rescind government policies that are in conflict with their rights, make a significant investment in education programs, increase general funding, and launch an enquiry into missing and murdered indigenous women. trudeau also indicated that the new government would implement all of the recommendations made by the truth and reconciliation commission.

trudeau has previously said that he would respect a first nations community's wishes regarding pipeline construction on their territory. some first nations leaders, including a councillor for the squamish first nation and prominent ""miâkmaw"" lawyer pam palmater have stated that they believe trudeau's purchase of the trans mountain pipeline violates this promise.

during the 2015 election campaign, trudeau said that if made prime minister, he would implement an infrastructure plan worth $60 billion (us$42 billion) in spending over 10 years. following his electoral win, in 2016, the trudeau announced a 12-year, $180 billion (us$143 billion) infrastructure plan, with a focus on public transport, infrastructure in rural communities and canada's northern regions, green infrastructure and affordable housing. the trudeau government also is setting up an infrastructure bank to fund projects.

trudeau first publicly expressed an interest in the legalization of marijuana while speaking at a rally in kelowna, b.c. on june 24, 2013. he told a crowd, ""i'm actually not in favour of decriminalizing cannabis. i'm in favour of legalizing it. tax it, regulate. it's one of the only ways to keep it out of the hands of our kids because the current war on drugs, the current model is not working. we have to use evidence and science to make sure we're moving forward on that.""

in an interview in august 2013, trudeau said that the last time he had used marijuana was in 2010, after he had become a member of parliament: ""we had a few good friends over for a dinner party, our kids were at their grandmother's for the night, and one of our friends lit a joint and passed it around. i had a puff."" after analysing the results of the legalization of marijuana in colorado, trudeau reiterated his position in favour of the legalization in canada, saying that canadians would benefit from analysing the experiences of both colorado and the state of washington.

after the liberal party formed the government in november 2015, with trudeau as prime minister, he announced that a federal-provincial-territorial process was being created to discuss a jointly suitable process for the legalization of marijuana possession for recreational purposes. the plan is to remove marijuana consumption and incidental possession from the criminal code; however, new laws will be enacted for greater punishment of those convicted of supplying pot to minors and for impairment while driving a motor vehicle. by late november 2015, justice minister jody wilson-raybould said that she and the ministers of health and public safety were working on specifics as to the legislation. in april 2016, the trudeau government announced that it would aim to introduce legislation to legalize cannabis in spring 2017.

the legislation to legalize cannabis for recreational use (cannabis act, bill c-45) was passed by the house of commons of canada in late november 2017; it passed second reading in the senate of canada on march 22, 2018. on june 18, 2018, the house passed the bill with most, but not all, of the senate's amendments. the senate accepted this version of the act the following day. prime minister justin trudeau announced the next day that recreational use of cannabis would no longer violate criminal law as of october 17, 2018. as of october 17, 2018, cannabis is legal in canada for both recreational and medicinal use.

on october 17, the first day of legalization, the government of canada announced that it intends to grant pardons to canadians convicted of simple cannabis possession charges.

trudeau has expressed opposition towards the proposed quebec charter of values, a controversial charter in that province and elsewhere that among other things prohibited public sector employees from wearing or displaying ""conspicuous"" religious symbols, justifying that it would make the people of quebec ""choose between their freedom of religion and freedom of expression, freedom of conscience and their economic well-being and their acceptance in the workplace. that for me is a real concern.""

trudeau has long advocated changes that would make the senate of canada a less partisan house. in january 2014, he announced a step that began reducing senate partisanship by removing liberal senators from the liberal caucus.

on december 5, 2015, after his appointment as prime minister, the new government's democratic institutions minister, maryam monsef, with house leader dominic leblanc, announced a major overhaul of the appointment process, as trudeau had promised during the election campaign. the new system consists of five board membersâthree federal appointees and two from the relevant provinceâwho will pick independent candidates, not officially affiliated with any political party, based on merit, a similar concept to the advisory committee on vice-regal appointments.

the stated goal of the december 2015 reform, was to improve the effectiveness of the senate which had been, according to monsef, ""hampered by its reputation as a partisan institution"". she indicated that this reform would not require an amendment to the constitution. the advisory board was expected to have been appointed by the end of december 2015. the criteria for appointment to the senate would be ""outstanding personal qualities that include integrity and ethics and experience in public life, community service or leadership in their field of expertise"". at the time of the announcement, there were 17 senate vacancies and these were expected to be filled by the end of 2016.

on february 8, 2019, ""the globe and mail"" reported that sources close to the government said that the prime minister's office had allegedly attempted to influence attorney general jody wilson-raybould concerning an ongoing prosecution of snc-lavalin. when asked about the allegations, trudeau said that the story in the ""globe"" was false and that he had never ""directed"" wilson-raybould concerning the case. wilson-raybould did not comment on the matter, citing solicitor-client privilege. soon after, trudeau voluntarily waived privilege and cabinet confidences, permitting her to speak. on february 11, the ethics commissioner announced the opening of an investigation into the allegations. trudeau said he ""welcomed the investigation"". the justice committee of the house of commons has conducted a series of hearings on the alleged interference. the investigation heard from several witnesses, including jody wilson-raybould, who submitted as evidence a telephone call she secretly recorded between herself and privy council clerk, michael wernick, which was subsequently released to the public. on the recording, wernick is heard asking to understand why the ""dpa route"" is not being used, stating that people were ""talking past each other"", and suggesting trudeau obtain independent legal advice from former supreme court justice beverly mclachlin. wilson-raybould is heard suggesting that trudeau would be ""breaching a constitutional principle of prosecutorial independence"". on march 19, 2019, the liberal committee members voted as a bloc to shut down the justice committee's investigation.

trudeau was the subject of an investigation by canada's ethics commissioner, pursuant to the ""conflict of interest act"", in regards to criminal charges against snc-lavalin in the snc-lavalin affair. the commission's final report, issued august 14, 2019, concluded ""mr. trudeau contravened section 9 of the act"".

during the 2015 election campaign, trudeau pledged to study the trans-pacific partnership (tpp) before making a final decision on ratification. trudeau said that canadians should know what effects tpp would have on different industries, adding that he would hold an open and serious discussion with canadians.

after the united states withdrew from the tpp, canada joined the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans-pacific partnership, which incorporates most of the provisions of the tpp and which entered into force on december 30, 2018.

trudeau identifies as a feminist, having stated, ""i am a feminist. i'm proud to be a feminist."" trudeau has also stated that ""the liberal party is unequivocal in its defence of women's rights. we are the party of the charter."" after being sworn in as prime minister, when asked by a reporter why he felt gender parity was important when naming his cabinet, he replied simply, ""because it's 2015."" more recently, he has similarly answered to feminist organizations on social media that ""on behalf of the government of canada, i am writing back to let you know that i wholeheartedly agree: poverty is sexist"".

in january 2018 in a speech at the world economic forum, trudeau called for critical discussion on issues brought up by the me too, time's up, and women's march movements. trudeau has also advocated a high standard and holds a ""zero tolerance for sexual assault, harassment or other forms of misconduct by his employees or caucus colleagues"". as leader of the liberal party, trudeau initiated investigations on several members of parliament resulting in the dismissal of cabinet minister kent hehr, the resignation of mp darshan kang, and the suspension and later expulsion of mps scott andrews and massimo pacetti. in an interview, trudeau explained that the zero tolerance standard applied to himself as well and stated, ""i've been very, very careful all my life to be thoughtful, to be respectful of people's space and people's headspace as well.""

in the april 2019 daughters of the vote event organized by equal voice canada in the house of commons, many of its delegates turned their backs when trudeau spoke as a protest for his actions of ousting former cabinet ministers jody wilson-raybould and jane philpott from the liberal caucus (see snc-lavalin affair).

on october 22, 2015, trudeau stated that, once prime minister, he would end canada's airstrike mission against isil. in his mandate letter to defence minister harjit sajjan, he also called for increased focus on canadian trainers for local troops and humanitarian aid for the region.<ref name=""iraq/syria trainers, aid""></ref>

on november 13, 2015, trudeau was asked whether his plans to change canada's contribution to the fight against isil and to repeal parts of bill c-51 would change following the terrorist attacks in paris. trudeau responded, ""it's too soon to jump to conclusions, but obviously governments have a responsibility to keep their citizens safe, while defending our rights and freedoms, and that balance is something the canadian government, and indeed all governments around the world, will be focusing on.""

on june 14, 2016, trudeau refused to recognize isis's atrocities as genocide, instead waiting for an official position from the un security council. he switched his position once the un commission released its inquiry on syria.

trudeau supported the harper-negotiated arms deal with saudi arabia, believed to be the largest arms sale in canadian history.

upon hearing the news of former president of cuba fidel castro's passing, trudeau released a statement that described castro as a ""remarkable leader"" and a ""larger than life leader who served his people"".

in 2017, trudeau criticized executive order 13769 entitled ""protecting the nation from foreign terrorist entry into the united states"" signed by president donald trump. the executive order bans refugees from seven countries, six of which have muslim majorities, from entering the united states. on social media, he displayed support for affected refugees.

in august 2018, canada called for the immediate release of saudi blogger raif badawi and his sister samar. in response to canada's criticism, saudi arabia expelled canada's ambassador, and froze trade with canada. trudeau said that canada will ""continue to speak clearly and firmly on issues of human rights at home and abroad wherever we see the need"".

in september 2018, as the rohingya crisis in myanmar became ethnic cleansing against the country's rohingya muslim minority, canada has stripped myanmar leader aung san suu kyi of her honorary canadian citizenship. in october 2018, trudeau condemned the killing of saudi dissident journalist jamal khashoggi at the saudi arabian consulate in istanbul and promised ""consequences"".

on september 11, 2019, trudeau visited the governor general, julie payette to request the dissolution of parliament the act which launches an election. prior to the formal start of the election, trudeau announced his intention to only participate in the three leaders' debates, two organized by the leaders' debates commission, and one organized by tva. however, trudeau opted to not attend the leaders' debates organized by citytv/""maclean's"", and the munk debates. the citytv/""maclean's"" debate was held on september 12, with an empty podium left on stage for trudeau. the munk debate on foreign policy was originally scheduled on october 1, although its organizers cancelled the event as a result of trudeau's decision to not attend. the french language tva debate is scheduled to occur on october 2. debates organized by the leaders' debates commission are scheduled to occur on october 7, and october 10; the former being an english language debate, the latter being in the french language.
in september 2019 controversial pictures and video were published showing trudeau in brownface and blackface. on september 18, 2019, ""time"" magazine published a photograph of trudeau wearing brownface makeup in the spring of 2001, at an ""arabian nights""-themed gala, while trudeau was a teacher at west point grey academy. trudeau publicly apologized, agreeing the photo was racist and saying: âi shouldnât have done that. i should have known better and i didnât. iâm really sorry.â he further went on to say ""it was something that i didnât think was racist at the time, but now i recognize it was something racist to do"". trudeau also admitted to wearing blackface makeup in high school while singing ""day-o"" at a talent show that was subsequently published by global news. a third instance of trudeau in racist dress was subsequently published. in this video, trudeau is wearing dark paint on his face, arms, and legs; he is laughing, raising his arms in the air, sticking his tongue out, and making faces.. after this video was published, trudeau admitted he could not remember how often he had worn blackface makeup.

in the days following the scandal, pollsters pointed out that many canadians either were not bothered by the scandal or had accepted trudeau's apology. additionally, minority community groups, racialized commentators and some of trudeau's opponents came to his defense. others were more critical, including members of his own party: liberal mp celina caesar-chavannes called it ""deplorable"", and asked ""what (prime minister of canada) does not know that painting your face and hands a different colour is wrong? who needs this teachable moment?"".

trudeau first met sophie grã©goire when they were both children growing up in montreal; grã©goire was a classmate and childhood friend of trudeau's youngest brother, michel. they reconnected as adults in june 2003, when grã©goire, by then a quebec television personality, was assigned as trudeau's co-host for a charity ball; they began dating several months later. trudeau and grã©goire became engaged in october 2004, and married on may 28, 2005, in a roman catholic ceremony at montreal's sainte-madeleine d'outremont church. they have three children: xavier james (born october 18, 2007), ella-grace margaret (born february 5, 2009) and hadrien grã©goire (born february 28, 2014).

in june 2013, two months after trudeau became the leader of the liberal party, the couple sold their home in the cã´te-des-neiges neighbourhood of montreal. they began living in a rented home in ottawa's rockcliffe park, the neighbourhood near where trudeau resided as a child during his father's time as prime minister.

on august 18, 2014, an intruder broke into the house while grã©goire and the couple's three children were sleeping and left a threatening note; however, nothing was stolen and there was no damage to the property. following the incident, trudeau, who was in winnipeg at the time of the break-in, stated his intention to inquire with the royal canadian mounted police about his home security. after his 2015 electoral victory, trudeau opted to live at rideau cottage, on the grounds of rideau hall, until necessary repairs are completed at 24 sussex to make it habitable.
trudeau's physical appearance has been the subject of many international publications. trudeau has a large earth inside a haida raven tattoo on his left arm. the tattoo is based on a design by robert davidson, a haida artist whose grandmother ceremonially adopted pierre trudeau as an honorary member of the haida tribe during a 1976 trip to what was then called the queen charlotte islands.

trudeau's father was a devout roman catholic and his mother converted from anglicanism to catholicism just prior to their wedding. as a child, justin attended mass each sunday and said his prayers each night before bedtime. he became a lapsed catholic at age 18, as he felt that much of his day-to-day life was not addressed by the formality and structure of the church. trudeau described his faith during this period as ""like so many catholics across this country, i said, 'ok, i'm catholic, i'm of faith, but i'm just not really going to go to church. maybe on easter, maybe midnight mass at christmas. after the death of his brother michel in 1998, trudeau was persuaded by a friend to participate in an alpha course, during which he regained his faith. in 2011, trudeau stated, ""my own personal faith is an extremely important part of who i am and the values that i try to lead with.""

"
stephen hawking,"
stephen william hawking (8 january 1942 â 14 march 2018) was an english theoretical physicist, cosmologist, and author who was director of research at the centre for theoretical cosmology at the university of cambridge at the time of his death. he was the lucasian professor of mathematics at the university of cambridge between 1979 and 2009.

his scientific works included a collaboration with roger penrose on gravitational singularity theorems in the framework of general relativity and the theoretical prediction that black holes emit radiation, often called hawking radiation. hawking was the first to set out a theory of cosmology explained by a union of the general theory of relativity and quantum mechanics. he was a vigorous supporter of the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.

hawking achieved commercial success with several works of popular science in which he discusses his own theories and cosmology in general. his book ""a brief history of time"" appeared on the british ""sunday times"" best-seller list for a record-breaking 237 weeks. hawking was a fellow of the royal society (frs), a lifetime member of the pontifical academy of sciences, and a recipient of the presidential medal of freedom, the highest civilian award in the united states. in 2002, hawking was ranked number 25 in the bbc's poll of the 100 greatest britons.

in 1963, hawking was diagnosed with an early-onset slow-progressing form of motor neurone disease (mnd; also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ""als"" or lou gehrig's disease) that gradually paralysed him over the decades. even after the loss of his speech, he was still able to communicate through a speech-generating device, initially through use of a hand-held switch, and eventually by using a single cheek muscle. he died on 14 march 2018 at the age of 76, after living with the disease for more than 50 years.

hawking was born on 8 january 1942 in oxford to frank (1905â1986) and isobel eileen hawking (nã©e walker; 1915â2013). hawking's mother was born into a family of doctors in glasgow, scotland. his wealthy paternal great-grandfather, from yorkshire, over-extended himself buying farm land and then went bankrupt in the great agricultural depression during the early 20th century. his paternal great-grandmother saved the family from financial ruin by opening a school in their home. despite their families' financial constraints, both parents attended the university of oxford, where frank read medicine and isobel read philosophy, politics and economics. isobel worked as a secretary for a medical research institute, and frank was a medical researcher. hawking had two younger sisters, philippa and mary, and an adopted brother, edward frank david (1955â2003).

in 1950, when hawking's father became head of the division of parasitology at the national institute for medical research, the family moved to st albans, hertfordshire. in st albans, the family was considered highly intelligent and somewhat eccentric; meals were often spent with each person silently reading a book. they lived a frugal existence in a large, cluttered, and poorly maintained house and travelled in a converted london taxicab. during one of hawking's father's frequent absences working in africa, the rest of the family spent four months in majorca visiting his mother's friend beryl and her husband, the poet robert graves.

hawking began his schooling at the byron house school in highgate, london. he later blamed its ""progressive methods"" for his failure to learn to read while at the school. in st albans, the eight-year-old hawking attended st albans high school for girls for a few months. at that time, younger boys could attend one of the houses.

hawking attended two independent (i.e. fee-paying) schools, first radlett school and from september 1952, st albans school, after passing the eleven-plus a year early. the family placed a high value on education. hawking's father wanted his son to attend the well-regarded westminster school, but the 13-year-old hawking was ill on the day of the scholarship examination. his family could not afford the school fees without the financial aid of a scholarship, so hawking remained at st albans. a positive consequence was that hawking remained close to a group of friends with whom he enjoyed board games, the manufacture of fireworks, model aeroplanes and boats, and long discussions about christianity and extrasensory perception. from 1958 on, with the help of the mathematics teacher dikran tahta, they built a computer from clock parts, an old telephone switchboard and other recycled components.

although known at school as ""einstein"", hawking was not initially successful academically. with time, he began to show considerable aptitude for scientific subjects and, inspired by tahta, decided to read mathematics at university. hawking's father advised him to study medicine, concerned that there were few jobs for mathematics graduates. he also wanted his son to attend university college, oxford, his own ""alma mater"". as it was not possible to read mathematics there at the time, hawking decided to study physics and chemistry. despite his headmaster's advice to wait until the next year, hawking was awarded a scholarship after taking the examinations in march 1959.

hawking began his university education at university college, oxford, in october 1959 at the age of 17. for the first 18 months, he was bored and lonelyhe found the academic work ""ridiculously easy"". his physics tutor, robert berman, later said, ""it was only necessary for him to know that something could be done, and he could do it without looking to see how other people did it."" a change occurred during his second and third year when, according to berman, hawking made more of an effort ""to be one of the boys"". he developed into a popular, lively and witty college member, interested in classical music and science fiction. part of the transformation resulted from his decision to join the college boat club, the university college boat club, where he coxed a rowing crew. the rowing coach at the time noted that hawking cultivated a daredevil image, steering his crew on risky courses that led to damaged boats.

hawking estimated that he studied about 1,000 hours during his three years at oxford. these unimpressive study habits made sitting his finals a challenge, and he decided to answer only theoretical physics questions rather than those requiring factual knowledge. a first-class honours degree was a condition of acceptance for his planned graduate study in cosmology at the university of cambridge. anxious, he slept poorly the night before the examinations, and the final result was on the borderline between first- and second-class honours, making a ""viva"" (oral examination) with the oxford examiners necessary.

hawking was concerned that he was viewed as a lazy and difficult student. so, when asked at the viva to describe his plans, he said, ""if you award me a first, i will go to cambridge. if i receive a second, i shall stay in oxford, so i expect you will give me a first."" he was held in higher regard than he believed; as berman commented, the examiners ""were intelligent enough to realise they were talking to someone far cleverer than most of themselves"". after receiving a first-class ba (hons.) degree in physics and completing a trip to iran with a friend, he began his graduate work at trinity hall, cambridge, in october 1962.

hawking's first year as a doctoral student was difficult. he was initially disappointed to find that he had been assigned dennis william sciama, one of the founders of modern cosmology, as a supervisor rather than noted yorkshire astronomer fred hoyle, and he found his training in mathematics inadequate for work in general relativity and cosmology. after being diagnosed with motor neurone disease, hawking fell into a depressionthough his doctors advised that he continue with his studies, he felt there was little point. his disease progressed more slowly than doctors had predicted. although hawking had difficulty walking unsupported, and his speech was almost unintelligible, an initial diagnosis that he had only two years to live proved unfounded. with sciama's encouragement, he returned to his work. hawking started developing a reputation for brilliance and brashness when he publicly challenged the work of fred hoyle and his student jayant narlikar at a lecture in june 1964.

when hawking began his graduate studies, there was much debate in the physics community about the prevailing theories of the creation of the universe: the big bang and steady state theories. inspired by roger penrose's theorem of a spacetime singularity in the centre of black holes, hawking applied the same thinking to the entire universe; and, during 1965, he wrote his thesis on this topic. hawking's thesis was approved in 1966. there were other positive developments: hawking received a research fellowship at gonville and caius college at cambridge; he obtained his phd degree in applied mathematics and theoretical physics, specialising in general relativity and cosmology, in march 1966; and his essay ""singularities and the geometry of space-time"" shared top honours with one by penrose to win that year's prestigious adams prize.

in his work, and in collaboration with penrose, hawking extended the singularity theorem concepts first explored in his doctoral thesis. this included not only the existence of singularities but also the theory that the universe might have started as a singularity. their joint essay was the runner-up in the 1968 gravity research foundation competition. in 1970, they published a proof that if the universe obeys the general theory of relativity and fits any of the models of physical cosmology developed by alexander friedmann, then it must have begun as a singularity. in 1969, hawking accepted a specially created fellowship for distinction in science to remain at caius.

in 1970, hawking postulated what became known as the second law of black hole dynamics, that the event horizon of a black hole can never get smaller. with james m. bardeen and brandon carter, he proposed the four laws of black hole mechanics, drawing an analogy with thermodynamics. to hawking's irritation, jacob bekenstein, a graduate student of john wheeler, went furtherâand ultimately correctlyâto apply thermodynamic concepts literally.

in the early 1970s, hawking's work with carter, werner israel and david c. robinson strongly supported wheeler's no-hair theorem, one that states that no matter what the original material from which a black hole is created, it can be completely described by the properties of mass, electrical charge and rotation. his essay titled ""black holes"" won the gravity research foundation award in january 1971. hawking's first book, ""the large scale structure of space-time,"" written with george ellis, was published in 1973.

beginning in 1973, hawking moved into the study of quantum gravity and quantum mechanics. his work in this area was spurred by a visit to moscow and discussions with yakov borisovich zel'dovich and alexei starobinsky, whose work showed that according to the uncertainty principle, rotating black holes emit particles. to hawking's annoyance, his much-checked calculations produced findings that contradicted his second law, which claimed black holes could never get smaller, and supported bekenstein's reasoning about their entropy.

his results, which hawking presented from 1974, showed that black holes emit radiation, known today as hawking radiation, which may continue until they exhaust their energy and evaporate. initially, hawking radiation was controversial. by the late 1970s and following the publication of further research, the discovery was widely accepted as a significant breakthrough in theoretical physics. hawking was elected a fellow of the royal society (frs) in 1974, a few weeks after the announcement of hawking radiation. at the time, he was one of the youngest scientists to become a fellow.

hawking was appointed to the sherman fairchild distinguished visiting professorship at the california institute of technology (caltech) in 1974. he worked with a friend on the faculty, kip thorne, and engaged him in a scientific wager about whether the x-ray source cygnus x-1 was a black hole. the wager was an ""insurance policy"" against the proposition that black holes did not exist. hawking acknowledged that he had lost the bet in 1990, a bet that was the first of several he was to make with thorne and others. hawking had maintained ties to caltech, spending a month there almost every year since this first visit.

hawking returned to cambridge in 1975 to a more academically senior post, as reader in gravitational physics. the mid to late 1970s were a period of growing public interest in black holes and the physicists who were studying them. hawking was regularly interviewed for print and television. he also received increasing academic recognition of his work. in 1975, he was awarded both the eddington medal and the pius xi gold medal, and in 1976 the dannie heineman prize, the maxwell prize and the hughes medal. he was appointed a professor with a chair in gravitational physics in 1977. the following year he received the albert einstein medal and an honorary doctorate from the university of oxford.

in 1979, hawking was elected lucasian professor of mathematics at the university of cambridge. his inaugural lecture in this role was titled: ""is the end in sight for theoretical physics?"" and proposed n=8 supergravity as the leading theory to solve many of the outstanding problems physicists were studying. his promotion coincided with a health crisis which led to his accepting, albeit reluctantly, some nursing services at home. at the same time, he was also making a transition in his approach to physics, becoming more intuitive and speculative rather than insisting on mathematical proofs. ""i would rather be right than rigorous"", he told kip thorne. in 1981, he proposed that information in a black hole is irretrievably lost when a black hole evaporates. this information paradox violates the fundamental tenet of quantum mechanics, and led to years of debate, including ""the black hole war"" with leonard susskind and gerard 't hooft.

cosmological inflationa theory proposing that following the big bang, the universe initially expanded incredibly rapidly before settling down to a slower expansionwas proposed by alan guth and also developed by andrei linde. following a conference in moscow in october 1981, hawking and gary gibbons organised a three-week nuffield workshop in the summer of 1982 on ""the very early universe"" at cambridge university, a workshop that focused mainly on inflation theory. hawking also began a new line of quantum theory research into the origin of the universe. in 1981 at a vatican conference, he presented work suggesting that there might be no boundaryor beginning or endingto the universe.

hawking subsequently developed the research in collaboration with jim hartle, and in 1983 they published a model, known as the hartleâhawking state. it proposed that prior to the planck epoch, the universe had no boundary in space-time; before the big bang, time did not exist and the concept of the beginning of the universe is meaningless. the initial singularity of the classical big bang models was replaced with a region akin to the north pole. one cannot travel north of the north pole, but there is no boundary thereit is simply the point where all north-running lines meet and end. initially, the no-boundary proposal predicted a closed universe, which had implications about the existence of god. as hawking explained, ""if the universe has no boundaries but is self-contained... then god would not have had any freedom to choose how the universe began.""

hawking did not rule out the existence of a creator, asking in ""a brief history of time"" ""is the unified theory so compelling that it brings about its own existence?"" in his early work, hawking spoke of god in a metaphorical sense. in ""a brief history of time"" he wrote: ""if we discover a complete theory, it would be the ultimate triumph of human reasonfor then we should know the mind of god."" in the same book he suggested that the existence of god was not necessary to explain the origin of the universe. later discussions with neil turok led to the realisation that the existence of god was also compatible with an open universe.

further work by hawking in the area of arrows of time led to the 1985 publication of a paper theorising that if the no-boundary proposition were correct, then when the universe stopped expanding and eventually collapsed, time would run backwards. a paper by don page and independent calculations by raymond laflamme led hawking to withdraw this concept. honours continued to be awarded: in 1981 he was awarded the american franklin medal, and in the 1982 new year honours appointed a commander of the order of the british empire (cbe). these awards did not significantly change hawking's financial status, and motivated by the need to finance his children's education and home expenses, he decided in 1982 to write a popular book about the universe that would be accessible to the general public. instead of publishing with an academic press, he signed a contract with bantam books, a mass market publisher, and received a large advance for his book. a first draft of the book, called ""a brief history of time"", was completed in 1984.

one of the first messages hawking produced with his speech-generating device was a request for his assistant to help him finish writing ""a brief history of time"". peter guzzardi, his editor at bantam, pushed him to explain his ideas clearly in non-technical language, a process that required many revisions from an increasingly irritated hawking. the book was published in april 1988 in the us and in june in the uk, and it proved to be an extraordinary success, rising quickly to the top of best-seller lists in both countries and remaining there for months. the book was translated into many languages, and ultimately sold an estimated 9million copies.

media attention was intense, and a ""newsweek"" magazine cover and a television special both described him as ""master of the universe"". success led to significant financial rewards, but also the challenges of celebrity status. hawking travelled extensively to promote his work, and enjoyed partying and dancing into the small hours. a difficulty refusing the invitations and visitors left him limited time for work and his students. some colleagues were resentful of the attention hawking received, feeling it was due to his disability.

he received further academic recognition, including five more honorary degrees, the gold medal of the royal astronomical society (1985), the paul dirac medal (1987) and, jointly with penrose, the prestigious wolf prize (1988). in the 1989 birthday honours, he was appointed a companion of honour (ch). he reportedly declined a knighthood in the late 1990s in objection to the uk's science funding policy.

hawking pursued his work in physics: in 1993 he co-edited a book on euclidean quantum gravity with gary gibbons and published a collected edition of his own articles on black holes and the big bang. in 1994, at cambridge's newton institute, hawking and penrose delivered a series of six lectures that were published in 1996 as ""the nature of space and time"". in 1997, he conceded a 1991 public scientific wager made with kip thorne and john preskill of caltech. hawking had bet that penrose's proposal of a ""cosmic censorship conjecture""that there could be no ""naked singularities"" unclothed within a horizonwas correct.

after discovering his concession might have been premature, a new and more refined wager was made. this one specified that such singularities would occur without extra conditions. the same year, thorne, hawking and preskill made another bet, this time concerning the black hole information paradox. thorne and hawking argued that since general relativity made it impossible for black holes to radiate and lose information, the mass-energy and information carried by hawking radiation must be ""new"", and not from inside the black hole event horizon. since this contradicted the quantum mechanics of microcausality, quantum mechanics theory would need to be rewritten. preskill argued the opposite, that since quantum mechanics suggests that the information emitted by a black hole relates to information that fell in at an earlier time, the concept of black holes given by general relativity must be modified in some way.

hawking also maintained his public profile, including bringing science to a wider audience. a film version of ""a brief history of time"", directed by errol morris and produced by steven spielberg, premiered in 1992. hawking had wanted the film to be scientific rather than biographical, but he was persuaded otherwise. the film, while a critical success, was not widely released. a popular-level collection of essays, interviews, and talks titled ""black holes and baby universes and other essays"" was published in 1993, and a six-part television series ""stephen hawking's universe"" and a companion book appeared in 1997. as hawking insisted, this time the focus was entirely on science.

hawking continued his writings for a popular audience, publishing ""the universe in a nutshell"" in 2001, and ""a briefer history of time"", which he wrote in 2005 with leonard mlodinow to update his earlier works with the aim of making them accessible to a wider audience, and ""god created the integers"", which appeared in 2006. along with at cern and jim hartle, from 2006 on hawking developed a theory of ""top-down cosmology"", which says that the universe had not one unique initial state but many different ones, and therefore that it is inappropriate to formulate a theory that predicts the universe's current configuration from one particular initial state. top-down cosmology posits that the present ""selects"" the past from a superposition of many possible histories. in doing so, the theory suggests a possible resolution of the fine-tuning question.

hawking continued to travel widely, including trips to chile, easter island, south africa, spain (to receive the fonseca prize in 2008), canada, and numerous trips to the united states. for practical reasons related to his disability, hawking increasingly travelled by private jet, and by 2011 that had become his only mode of international travel.

by 2003, consensus among physicists was growing that hawking was wrong about the loss of information in a black hole. in a 2004 lecture in dublin, he conceded his 1997 bet with preskill, but described his own, somewhat controversial solution to the information paradox problem, involving the possibility that black holes have more than one topology. in the 2005 paper he published on the subject, he argued that the information paradox was explained by examining all the alternative histories of universes, with the information loss in those with black holes being cancelled out by those without such loss. in january 2014, he called the alleged loss of information in black holes his ""biggest blunder"".

as part of another longstanding scientific dispute, hawking had emphatically argued, and bet, that the higgs boson would never be found. the particle was proposed to exist as part of the higgs field theory by peter higgs in 1964. hawking and higgs engaged in a heated and public debate over the matter in 2002 and again in 2008, with higgs criticising hawking's work and complaining that hawking's ""celebrity status gives him instant credibility that others do not have."" the particle was discovered in july 2012 at cern following construction of the large hadron collider. hawking quickly conceded that he had lost his bet and said that higgs should win the nobel prize for physics, which he did in 2013.

in 2007, hawking and his daughter lucy published ""george's secret key to the universe"", a children's book designed to explain theoretical physics in an accessible fashion and featuring characters similar to those in the hawking family. the book was followed by sequels in 2009, 2011, 2014 and 2016.

in 2002, following a uk-wide vote, the bbc included hawking in their list of the 100 greatest britons. he was awarded the copley medal from the royal society (2006), the presidential medal of freedom, which is america's highest civilian honour (2009), and the russian special fundamental physics prize (2013).

several buildings have been named after him, including the stephen w. hawking science museum in san salvador, elsalvador, the stephen hawking building in cambridge, and the stephen hawking centre at the perimeter institute in canada. appropriately, given hawking's association with time, he unveiled the mechanical ""chronophage"" (or time-eating) corpus clock at corpus christi college, cambridge in september 2008.

during his career, hawking supervised 39 successful phd students. one doctoral student did not successfully complete the phd. as required by cambridge university regulations, hawking retired as lucasian professor of mathematics in 2009. despite suggestions that he might leave the united kingdom as a protest against public funding cuts to basic scientific research, hawking worked as director of research at the cambridge university department of applied mathematics and theoretical physics.

on 28 june 2009, as a tongue-in-cheek test of his 1992 conjecture that travel into the past is effectively impossible, hawking held a party open to all, complete with hors d'oeuvres and iced champagne, but publicised the party only after it was over so that only time-travellers would know to attend; as expected, nobody showed up to the party.

on 20 july 2015, hawking helped launch breakthrough initiatives, an effort to search for extraterrestrial life. hawking created ""stephen hawking: expedition new earth"", a documentary on space colonisation, as a 2017 episode of ""tomorrow's world"".

in august 2015, hawking said that not all information is lost when something enters a black hole and there might be a possibility to retrieve information from a black hole according to his theory. in july 2017, hawking was awarded an honorary doctorate from imperial college london.

hawking's final paper â ""a smooth exit from eternal inflation?"" â was posthumously published in the ""journal of high energy physics"" on 27 april 2018.

hawking met his future wife, jane wilde, at a party in 1962. the following year, hawking was diagnosed with motor neuron disease. in october 1964, the couple became engaged to marry, aware of the potential challenges that lay ahead due to hawking's shortened life expectancy and physical limitations. hawking later said that the engagement gave him ""something to live for"". the two were married on 14 july 1965 in their shared hometown of st albans.

the couple resided in cambridge, within hawking's walking distance to the department of applied mathematics and theoretical physics (damtp). during their first years of marriage, jane lived in london during the week as she completed her degree at westfield college. they travelled to the united states several times for conferences and physics-related visits. jane began a phd programme through westfield college in medieval spanish poetry (completed in 1981). the couple had three children: robert, born may 1967, lucy, born november 1969, and timothy, born april 1979.

hawking rarely discussed his illness and physical challenges, evenin a precedent set during their courtshipwith jane. his disabilities meant that the responsibilities of home and family rested firmly on his wife's increasingly overwhelmed shoulders, leaving him more time to think about physics. upon his appointment in 1974 to a year-long position at the california institute of technology in pasadena, california, jane proposed that a graduate or post-doctoral student live with them and help with his care. hawking accepted, and bernard carr travelled with them as the first of many students who fulfilled this role. the family spent a generally happy and stimulating year in pasadena.

hawking returned to cambridge in 1975 to a new home and a new job, as reader. don page, with whom hawking had begun a close friendship at caltech, arrived to work as the live-in graduate student assistant. with page's help and that of a secretary, jane's responsibilities were reduced so she could return to her doctoral thesis and her new interest in singing.

around december 1977, jane met organist jonathan hellyer jones when singing in a church choir. hellyer jones became close to the hawking family, and by the mid-1980s, he and jane had developed romantic feelings for each other. according to jane, her husband was accepting of the situation, stating ""he would not object so long as i continued to love him"". jane and hellyer jones determined not to break up the family, and their relationship remained platonic for a long period.

by the 1980s, hawking's marriage had been strained for many years. jane felt overwhelmed by the intrusion into their family life of the required nurses and assistants. the impact of his celebrity was challenging for colleagues and family members, while the prospect of living up to a worldwide fairytale image was daunting for the couple. hawking's views of religion also contrasted with her strong christian faith and resulted in tension. after a tracheotomy in 1985, hawking required a nurse 24/7 and nursing care was split across 3 shifts daily. in the late 1980s, hawking grew close to one of his nurses, elaine mason, to the dismay of some colleagues, caregivers, and family members, who were disturbed by her strength of personality and protectiveness. in february 1990, hawking told jane that he was leaving her for mason, and departed the family home. after his divorce from jane in 1995, hawking married mason in september, declaring, ""it's wonderfuli have married the woman i love.""

in 1999, jane hawking published a memoir, ""music to move the stars"", describing her marriage to hawking and its breakdown. its revelations caused a sensation in the media but, as was his usual practice regarding his personal life, hawking made no public comment except to say that he did not read biographies about himself. after his second marriage, hawking's family felt excluded and marginalised from his life. for a period of about five years in the early 2000s, his family and staff became increasingly worried that he was being physically abused. police investigations took place, but were closed as hawking refused to make a complaint.

in 2006, hawking and mason quietly divorced, and hawking resumed closer relationships with jane, his children, and his grandchildren. reflecting on this happier period, a revised version of jane's book, re-titled ""travelling to infinity: my life with stephen"", appeared in 2007, and was made into a film, ""the theory of everything"", in 2014.

hawking had a rare early-onset slow-progressing form of motor neurone disease (mnd; also known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, ""als"", or lou gehrig's disease), a terminal illness that affects and causes the degeneration of motor neurons of the brain and spinal cord, which gradually paralysed him over decades.

hawking had experienced increasing clumsiness during his final year at oxford, including a fall on some stairs and difficulties when rowing. the problems worsened, and his speech became slightly slurred and his family noticed the changes when he returned home for christmas, and medical investigations were begun. the mnd diagnosis came when hawking was 21, in 1963. at the time, doctors gave him a life expectancy of two years.

in the late 1960s, hawking's physical abilities declined: he began to use crutches and could no longer give lectures regularly. as he slowly lost the ability to write, he developed compensatory visual methods, including seeing equations in terms of geometry. the physicist werner israel later compared the achievements to mozart composing an entire symphony in his head. hawking was fiercely independent and unwilling to accept help or make concessions for his disabilities. he preferred to be regarded as ""a scientist first, popular science writer second, and, in all the ways that matter, a normal human being with the same desires, drives, dreams, and ambitions as the next person."" his wife, jane hawking, later noted: ""some people would call it determination, some obstinacy. i've called it both at one time or another."" he required much persuasion to accept the use of a wheelchair at the end of the 1960s, but ultimately became notorious for the wildness of his wheelchair driving. hawking was a popular and witty colleague, but his illness, as well as his reputation for brashness, distanced him from some.

when hawking first began using a wheelchair in the late 1970s he was using standard motorised models. the earliest surviving example of these chairs was made by bec mobility and sold by christie's in november 2018 for â£296,750. hawking continued to use this type of chair until the early 1990s, at which time his ability to use his hands to drive a wheelchair deteriorated. hawking used a variety of different chairs from that time, including a dragonmobility dragon elevating powerchair from 2007, as shown in the april 2008 photo of hawking attending nasa's 50th anniversary; a permobil c350 from 2014; and then a permobil f3 from 2016.

hawking's speech deteriorated, and by the late 1970s he could be understood by only his family and closest friends. to communicate with others, someone who knew him well would interpret his speech into intelligible speech. spurred by a dispute with the university over who would pay for the ramp needed for him to enter his workplace, hawking and his wife campaigned for improved access and support for those with disabilities in cambridge, including adapted student housing at the university. in general, hawking had ambivalent feelings about his role as a disability rights champion: while wanting to help others, he also sought to detach himself from his illness and its challenges. his lack of engagement in this area led to some criticism.

during a visit to cern on the border of france and switzerland in mid-1985, hawking contracted pneumonia, which in his condition was life-threatening; he was so ill that jane was asked if life support should be terminated. she refused, but the consequence was a tracheotomy, which required round-the-clock nursing care and the removal of what remained of his speech. the national health service was ready to pay for a nursing home, but jane was determined that he would live at home. the cost of the care was funded by an american foundation. nurses were hired for the three shifts required to provide the round-the-clock support he required. one of those employed was elaine mason, who was to become hawking's second wife.

for his communication, hawking initially raised his eyebrows to choose letters on a spelling card, but in 1986 he received a computer program called the ""equalizer"" from walter woltosz, ceo of words plus, who had developed an earlier version of the software to help his mother-in-law, who also suffered from als and had lost her ability to speak and write. in a method he used for the rest of his life, hawking could now simply press a switch to select phrases, words or letters from a bank of about 2,500â3,000 that were scanned. the program was originally run on a desktop computer. elaine mason's husband, david, a computer engineer, adapted a small computer and attached it to his wheelchair.

released from the need to use somebody to interpret his speech, hawking commented that ""i can communicate better now than before i lost my voice."" the voice he used had an american accent and is no longer produced. despite the later availability of other voices, hawking retained this original voice, saying that he preferred it and identified with it. originally, hawking activated a switch using his hand and could produce up to 15 words a minute. lectures were prepared in advance and were sent to the speech synthesizer in short sections to be delivered.

hawking gradually lost the use of his hand, and in 2005 he began to control his communication device with movements of his cheek muscles, with a rate of about one word per minute. with this decline there was a risk of his developing locked-in syndrome, so hawking collaborated with intel researchers on systems that could translate his brain patterns or facial expressions into switch activations. after several prototypes that did not perform as planned, they settled on an adaptive word predictor made by the london-based startup swiftkey, which used a system similar to his original technology. hawking had an easier time adapting to the new system, which was further developed after inputting large amounts of hawking's papers and other written materials and uses predictive software similar to other smartphone keyboards.

by 2009, he could no longer drive his wheelchair independently, but the same people who created his new typing mechanics were working on a method to drive his chair using movements made by his chin. this proved difficult, since hawking could not move his neck, and trials showed that while he could indeed drive the chair, the movement was sporadic and jumpy. near the end of his life, hawking experienced increased breathing difficulties, often resulting in his requiring the usage of a ventilator, and being regularly hospitalised.

starting in the 1990s, hawking accepted the mantle of role model for disabled people, lecturing and participating in fundraising activities. at the turn of the century, he and eleven other luminaries signed the ""charter for the third millennium on disability"", which called on governments to prevent disability and protect the rights of the disabled. in 1999, hawking was awarded the julius edgar lilienfeld prize of the american physical society.

in august 2012, hawking narrated the ""enlightenment"" segment of the 2012 summer paralympics opening ceremony in london. in 2013, the biographical documentary film ""hawking"", in which hawking himself is featured, was released. in september 2013, he expressed support for the legalisation of assisted suicide for the terminally ill. in august 2014, hawking accepted the ice bucket challenge to promote als/mnd awareness and raise contributions for research. as he had pneumonia in 2013, he was advised not to have ice poured over him, but his children volunteered to accept the challenge on his behalf.

in late 2006, hawking revealed in a bbc interview that one of his greatest unfulfilled desires was to travel to space; on hearing this, richard branson offered a free flight into space with virgin galactic, which hawking immediately accepted. besides personal ambition, he was motivated by the desire to increase public interest in spaceflight and to show the potential of people with disabilities. on 26 april 2007, hawking flew aboard a specially-modified boeing 727-200 jet operated by zero-g corp off the coast of florida to experience weightlessness. fears the manoeuvres would cause him undue discomfort proved groundless, and the flight was extended to eight parabolic arcs. it was described as a successful test to see if he could withstand the g-forces involved in space flight. at the time, the date of hawking's trip to space was projected to be as early as 2009, but commercial flights to space did not commence before his death.

hawking died at his home in cambridge, england, on 14 march 2018, at the age of 76. his family stated that he ""died peacefully"". he was eulogised by figures in science, entertainment, politics, and other areas. the gonville and caius college flag flew at half-mast and a book of condolences was signed by students and visitors. a tribute was made to hawking in the closing speech by ipc president andrew parsons at the closing ceremony of the 2018 paralympic winter games in pyeongchang, south korea.

hawking was born on the 300th anniversary of galileo's death and died on the 139th anniversary of einstein's birth. his private funeral took place at 2â pm on the afternoon of 31 march 2018, at great st mary's church, cambridge. guests at the funeral included ""the theory of everything"" actors eddie redmayne and felicity jones, queen guitarist and astrophysicist brian may, and model lily cole. in addition, actor benedict cumberbatch, who played hawking in ""hawking"", astronaut tim peake, astronomer royal martin rees and physicist kip thorne provided readings at the service. following the cremation, a service of thanksgiving was held at westminster abbey on 15 june 2018, after which his ashes were interred in the abbey's nave, between the graves of sir isaac newton and charles darwin.

inscribed on his memorial stone are the words ""here lies what was mortal of stephen hawking 1942â2018"" and his most famed equation. he directed, at least fifteen years before his death, that the bekensteinâhawking entropy equation be his epitaph.{k} = \frac{1}{4} \frac{a}{a_\text{p}},</math>

where formula_1 is the planck area (the unit of area in quantum mechanics). use of planck units (in which formula_2 and formula_3 are set to unity) reduces it further to:

jacob bekenstein had conjectured the proportionality; hawking confirmed it and established the constant of proportionality at formula_5. calculations based on string theory, first carried out in 1995, have been found to yield the same result.

this relationship is conjectured to be valid not just for black holes, but also (since entropy is proportional to information) as an upper bound on the amount of information that can be contained in any volume of space, which has in turn spawned deeper reflections on the possible nature of reality.}} in june 2018, it was announced that hawking's words, set to music by greek composer vangelis, would be beamed into space from a european space agency satellite dish in spain with the aim of reaching the nearest black hole, 1a 0620-00.

hawking's final broadcast interview, about the detection of gravitational waves resulting from the collision of two neutron stars, occurred in october 2017. his final words to the world appeared posthumously, in april 2018, in the form of a smithsonian tv channel documentary entitled, ""leaving earth: or how to colonize a planet"". one of his final research studies, entitled ""a smooth exit from eternal inflation?"", about the origin of the universe, was published in the journal of high energy physics in may 2018. later, in october 2018, another of his final research studies, entitled ""black hole entropy and soft hair"", was published, and dealt with the ""mystery of what happens to the information held by objects once they disappear into a black hole"". also in october 2018, hawking's last book, ""brief answers to the big questions"", a popular science book presenting his final comments on the most important questions facing humankind, was published.

on 8 november 2018, an auction of 22 personal possessions of stephen hawking, including his doctoral thesis (""""properties of expanding universes"""", phd thesis, cambridge university, 1965) and wheelchair, took place, and fetched about â£1.8â m (more than $2.3â m). proceeds from the auction sale of the wheelchair went to two charities, the motor neurone disease association and the stephen hawking foundation; proceeds from hawking's other items went to his estate.

in march 2019, it was announced that the royal mint issued a commemorative 50 pence coin in honour of hawking. the same month, it was reported that hawking's nurse, patricia dowdy, had been handed an interim suspension in 2016 for ""failures over his care and financial misconduct.""

in 2006, hawking posed an open question on the internet: ""in a world that is in chaos politically, socially and environmentally, how can the human race sustain another 100 years?"", later clarifying: ""i don't know the answer. that is why i asked the question, to get people to think about it, and to be aware of the dangers we now face.""

hawking expressed concern that life on earth is at risk from a sudden nuclear war, a genetically engineered virus, global warming, or other dangers humans have not yet thought of. hawking stated: ""i regard it as almost inevitable that either a nuclear confrontation or environmental catastrophe will cripple the earth at some point in the next 1,000 years"", and considered an ""asteroid collision"" to be the biggest threat to the planet. such a planet-wide disaster need not result in human extinction if the human race were to be able to colonise additional planets before the disaster. hawking viewed spaceflight and the colonisation of space as necessary for the future of humanity.

hawking stated that, given the vastness of the universe, aliens likely exist, but that contact with them should be avoided. he warned that aliens might pillage earth for resources. in 2010 he said, ""if aliens visit us, the outcome would be much as when columbus landed in america, which didn't turn out well for the native americans.""

hawking warned that superintelligent artificial intelligence could be pivotal in steering humanity's fate, stating that ""the potential benefits are huge... success in creating ai would be the biggest event in human history. it might also be the last, unless we learn how to avoid the risks."" however, he argued that we should be more frightened of capitalism exacerbating economic inequality than robots.

hawking was concerned about the future emergence of a race of ""superhumans"" that would be able to design their own evolution and, as well, argued that computer viruses in today's world should be considered a new form of life, stating that ""maybe it says something about human nature, that the only form of life we have created so far is purely destructive. talk about creating life in our own image.""

at google's zeitgeist conference in 2011, hawking said that ""philosophy is dead"". he believed that philosophers ""have not kept up with modern developments in science"" and that scientists ""have become the bearers of the torch of discovery in our quest for knowledge"". he said that philosophical problems can be answered by science, particularly new scientific theories which ""lead us to a new and very different picture of the universe and our place in it"".

hawking was an atheist and believed that ""the universe is governed by the laws of science"". he stated: ""there is a fundamental difference between religion, which is based on authority, [and] science, which is based on observation and reason. science will win because it works."" in an interview published in ""the guardian"", hawking regarded ""the brain as a computer which will stop working when its components fail"", and the concept of an afterlife as a ""fairy story for people afraid of the dark"". in 2011, narrating the first episode of the american television series ""curiosity"" on the discovery channel, hawking declared:

hawking's association with atheism and freethinking was in evidence from his university years onwards, when he had been a member of oxford university's humanist group. he was later scheduled to appear as the keynote speaker at a 2017 humanists uk conference. in an interview with ""el mundo"", he said:

in addition, hawking stated:
hawking was a longstanding labour party supporter. he recorded a tribute for the 2000 democratic presidential candidate al gore, called the 2003 invasion of iraq a ""war crime"", supported the academic boycott of israel, campaigned for nuclear disarmament, and supported stem cell research, universal health care, and action to prevent climate change. in august 2014, hawking was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to ""the guardian"" expressing their hope that scotland would vote to remain part of the united kingdom in september's referendum on that issue. hawking believed a united kingdom withdrawal from the european union (brexit) would damage the uk's contribution to science as modern research needs international collaboration, and that free movement of people in europe encourages the spread of ideas. hawking was disappointed by brexit and warned against envy and isolationism.

hawking was greatly concerned over health care, and maintained that without the uk national health service, he could not have survived into his 70s. he stated, ""i have received excellent medical attention in britain, and i felt it was important to set the record straight. i believe in universal health care. and i am not afraid to say so.""

hawking feared privatisation. he stated, ""the more profit is extracted from the system, the more private monopolies grow and the more expensive healthcare becomes. the nhs must be preserved from commercial interests and protected from those who want to privatise it."" hawking alleged ministers damaged the nhs, he blamed the conservatives for cutting funding, weakening the nhs by privatisation, lowering staff morale through holding pay back and reducing social care. hawking accused jeremy hunt of cherry picking evidence which hawking maintained debased science.<ref name=""bbc20/8/2017""></ref> hawking also stated, ""there is overwhelming evidence that nhs funding and the numbers of doctors and nurses are inadequate, and it is getting worse.""

in june 2017, hawking endorsed the labour party in the 2017 uk general election, citing the conservatives' proposed cuts to the nhs. but he was also critical of labour leader jeremy corbyn, expressing scepticism over whether the party could win a general election under him.

hawking feared donald trump's policies on global warming could endanger the planet and make global warming irreversible. he said, ""climate change is one of the great dangers we face, and it's one we can prevent if we act now. by denying the evidence for climate change, and pulling out of the paris agreement, donald trump will cause avoidable environmental damage to our beautiful planet, endangering the natural world, for us and our children."" hawking further stated that this could lead earth ""to become like venus, with a temperature of two hundred and fifty degrees, and raining sulphuric acid"".

in 1988, hawking, arthur c. clarke and carl sagan were interviewed in ""god, the universe and everything else"". they discussed the big bang theory, god and the possibility of extraterrestrial life.

at the release party for the home video version of the ""a brief history of time"", leonard nimoy, who had played spock on ""star trek"", learned that hawking was interested in appearing on the show. nimoy made the necessary contact, and hawking played a holographic simulation of himself in an episode of """" in 1993. the same year, his synthesiser voice was recorded for the pink floyd song ""keep talking"", and in 1999 for an appearance on ""the simpsons"". hawking appeared in documentaries titled ""the real stephen hawking"" (2001), ""stephen hawking: profile"" (2002) and ""hawking"" (2013), and the documentary series ""stephen hawking, master of the universe"" (2008). hawking also guest-starred in ""futurama"" and had a recurring role in ""the big bang theory"".

hawking allowed the use of his copyrighted voice in the biographical 2014 film ""the theory of everything"", in which he was portrayed by eddie redmayne in an academy award-winning role. hawking was featured at the ""monty python live (mostly)"" in 2014. he was shown to sing an extended version of the âgalaxy songâ, after running down brian cox with his wheelchair, in a pre-recorded video.

hawking used his fame to advertise products, including a wheelchair, national savings, british telecom, specsavers, egg banking, and go compare. in 2015, he applied to trademark his name.

broadcast in march 2018 just a week or two before his death, hawking was the voice of the book mark ii on ""the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy"" radio series, and he was the guest of neil degrasse tyson on ""startalk"".

hawking received numerous awards and honours. already early in the list, in 1974 he was elected a fellow of the royal society (frs). at that time, his nomination read:

the citation continues, ""other important work by hawking relates to the interpretation of cosmological observations and to the design of gravitational wave detectors.""

hawking received the 2015 bbva foundation frontiers of knowledge award in basic sciences shared with viatcheslav mukhanov for discovering that the galaxies were formed from quantum fluctuations in the early universe. at the 2016 pride of britain awards, hawking received the lifetime achievement award ""for his contribution to science and british culture"". after receiving the award from prime minister theresa may, hawking humorously requested that she not seek his help with brexit.

hawking was a member of the advisory board of the starmus festival, and had a major role in acknowledging and promoting science communication. the stephen hawking medal for science communication is an annual award initiated in 2016 to honour members of the arts community for contributions that help build awareness of science. recipients receive a medal bearing a portrait of hawking by alexei leonov, and the other side represents an image of leonov himself performing the first spacewalk along with an image of the ""red special"", the guitar of queen musician and astrophysicist brian may (with music being another major component of the starmus festival).

the starmus iii festival in 2016 was a tribute to stephen hawking and the book of all starmus iii lectures, ""beyond the horizon"", was also dedicated to him. the first recipients of the medals, which were awarded at the festival, were chosen by hawking himself. they were composer hans zimmer, physicist jim al-khalili, and the science documentary ""particle fever"".

nelson mandela,"
nelson rolihlahla mandela (; ; 18 july 1918â â 5 december 2013) was a south african anti-apartheid revolutionary, political leader, and philanthropist who served as president of south africa from 1994 to 1999. he was the country's first black head of state and the first elected in a fully representative democratic election. his government focused on dismantling the legacy of apartheid by tackling institutionalised racism and fostering racial reconciliation. ideologically an african nationalist and socialist, he served as president of the african national congress (anc) party from 1991 to 1997.
a xhosa, mandela was born to the thembu royal family in mvezo, british south africa. he studied law at the university of fort hare and the university of witwatersrand before working as a lawyer in johannesburg. there he became involved in anti-colonial and african nationalist politics, joining the anc in 1943 and co-founding its youth league in 1944. after the national party's white-only government established apartheid, a system of racial segregation that privileged whites, he and the anc committed themselves to its overthrow. mandela was appointed president of the anc's transvaal branch, rising to prominence for his involvement in the 1952 defiance campaign and the 1955 congress of the people. he was repeatedly arrested for seditious activities and was unsuccessfully prosecuted in the 1956 treason trial. influenced by marxism, he secretly joined the banned south african communist party (sacp). although initially committed to non-violent protest, in association with the sacp he co-founded the militant umkhonto we sizwe in 1961 and led a sabotage campaign against the government. he was arrested and imprisoned in 1962, and subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment for conspiring to overthrow the state following the rivonia trial.
mandela served 27 years in prison, split between robben island, pollsmoor prison, and victor verster prison. amid growing domestic and international pressure, and with fears of a racial civil war, president f. w. de klerk released him in 1990. mandela and de klerk led efforts to negotiate an end to apartheid, which resulted in the 1994 multiracial general election in which mandela led the anc to victory and became president. leading a broad coalition government which promulgated a new constitution, mandela emphasised reconciliation between the country's racial groups and created the truth and reconciliation commission to investigate past human rights abuses. economically, mandela's administration retained its predecessor's liberal framework despite his own socialist beliefs, also introducing measures to encourage land reform, combat poverty, and expand healthcare services. internationally, he acted as mediator in the pan am flight 103 bombing trial and served as secretary-general of the non-aligned movement from 1998 to 1999. he declined a second presidential term, and in 1999 was succeeded by his deputy, thabo mbeki. mandela became an elder statesman and focused on combating poverty and hiv/aids through the charitable nelson mandela foundation.
mandela was a controversial figure for much of his life. although critics on the right denounced him as a communist terrorist and those on the far-left deemed him too eager to negotiate and reconcile with apartheid's supporters, he gained international acclaim for his activism. widely regarded as an icon of democracy and social justice, he received more than 250 honoursâincluding the nobel peace prizeâand became the subject of a cult of personality. he is held in deep respect within south africa, where he is often referred to by his xhosa clan name, madiba, and described as the ""father of the nation"".

mandela was born on 18 july 1918 in the village of mvezo in umtata, then part of south africa's cape province. given the forename rolihlahla, a xhosa term colloquially meaning ""troublemaker"", in later years he became known by his clan name, madiba. his patrilineal great-grandfather, ngubengcuka, was king of the thembu people in the transkeian territories of south africa's modern eastern cape province. one of ngubengcuka's sons, named mandela, was nelson's grandfather and the source of his surname. because mandela was the king's child by a wife of the ixhiba clan, a so-called ""left-hand house"", the descendants of his cadet branch of the royal family were morganatic, ineligible to inherit the throne but recognised as hereditary royal councillors.

nelson mandela's father, gadla henry mphakanyiswa mandela (1880â1928), was a local chief and councillor to the monarch; he was appointed to the position in 1915, after his predecessor was accused of corruption by a governing white magistrate. in 1926, gadla was also sacked for corruption, but nelson was told that his father had lost his job for standing up to the magistrate's unreasonable demands. a devotee of the god qamata, gadla was a polygamist with four wives, four sons and nine daughters, who lived in different villages. nelson's mother was gadla's third wife, nosekeni fanny, daughter of nkedama of the right hand house and a member of the amampemvu clan of the xhosa.

mandela later stated that his early life was dominated by traditional thembu custom and taboo. he grew up with two sisters in his mother's ""kraal"" in the village of qunu, where he tended herds as a cattle-boy and spent much time outside with other boys. both his parents were illiterate, but being a devout christian, his mother sent him to a local methodist school when he was about seven. baptised a methodist, mandela was given the english forename of ""nelson"" by his teacher. when mandela was about nine, his father came to stay at qunu, where he died of an undiagnosed ailment which mandela believed to be lung disease. feeling ""cut adrift"", he later said that he inherited his father's ""proud rebelliousness"" and ""stubborn sense of fairness"".

mandela's mother took him to the ""great place"" palace at mqhekezweni, where he was entrusted to the guardianship of the thembu regent, chief jongintaba dalindyebo. although he did not see his mother again for many years, mandela felt that jongintaba and his wife noengland treated him as their own child, raising him alongside their son, justice, and daughter, nomafu. as mandela attended church services every sunday with his guardians, christianity became a significant part of his life. he attended a methodist mission school located next to the palace, where he studied english, xhosa, history and geography. he developed a love of african history, listening to the tales told by elderly visitors to the palace, and was influenced by the anti-imperialist rhetoric of a visiting chief, joyi. at the time he nevertheless considered the european colonialists not as oppressors but as benefactors who had brought education and other benefits to southern africa. aged 16, he, justice and several other boys travelled to tyhalarha to undergo the ulwaluko circumcision ritual that symbolically marked their transition from boys to men; afterwards he was given the name ""dalibunga"".

intending to gain skills needed to become a privy councillor for the thembu royal house, in 1933 mandela began his secondary education at clarkebury methodist high school in engcobo, a western-style institution that was the largest school for black africans in thembuland. made to socialise with other students on an equal basis, he claimed that he lost his ""stuck up"" attitude, becoming best friends with a girl for the first time; he began playing sports and developed his lifelong love of gardening. he completed his junior certificate in two years, and in 1937 moved to healdtown, the methodist college in fort beaufort attended by most thembu royalty, including justice. the headmaster emphasised the superiority of english culture and government, but mandela became increasingly interested in native african culture, making his first non-xhosa friend, a speaker of sotho, and coming under the influence of one of his favourite teachers, a xhosa who broke taboo by marrying a sotho. mandela spent much of his spare time at healdtown as a long-distance runner and boxer, and in his second year he became a prefect.

with jongintaba's backing, in 1939 mandela began work on a ba degree at the university of fort hare, an elite black institution in alice, eastern cape, with around 150 students. there he studied english, anthropology, politics, native administration, and roman dutch law in his first year, desiring to become an interpreter or clerk in the native affairs department. mandela stayed in the wesley house dormitory, befriending his own kinsman, k. d. matanzima, as well as oliver tambo, who became a close friend and comrade for decades to come. he took up ballroom dancing, performed in a drama society play about abraham lincoln, and gave bible classes in the local community as part of the student christian association. although he had friends connected to the african national congress (anc) who wanted south africa to be independent of the british empire, mandela avoided any involvement with the anti-imperialist movement, and became a vocal supporter of the british war effort when the second world war broke out. he helped to found a first-year students' house committee which challenged the dominance of the second-years, and at the end of his first year became involved in a students' representative council (src) boycott against the quality of food, for which he was suspended from the university; he never returned to complete his degree.

returning to mqhekezweni in december 1940, mandela found that jongintaba had arranged marriages for him and justice; dismayed, they fled to johannesburg via queenstown, arriving in april 1941. mandela found work as a night watchman at crown mines, his ""first sight of south african capitalism in action"", but was fired when the ""induna"" (headman) discovered that he was a runaway. he stayed with a cousin in george goch township, who introduced mandela to realtor and anc activist walter sisulu. the latter secured mandela a job as an articled clerk at the law firm of witkin, sidelsky and eidelman, a company run by lazar sidelsky, a liberal jew sympathetic to the anc's cause. at the firm, mandela befriended gaur radebeâa xhosa member of the anc and communist partyâand nat bregman, a jewish communist who became his first white friend. mandela attended communist party gatherings, where he was impressed that europeans, africans, indians, and coloureds mixed as equals. he later stated that he did not join the party because its atheism conflicted with his christian faith, and because he saw the south african struggle as being racially based rather than as class warfare. to continue his higher education, mandela signed up to a university of south africa correspondence course, working on his bachelor's degree at night.

earning a small wage, mandela rented a room in the house of the xhoma family in the alexandra township; despite being rife with poverty, crime and pollution, alexandra always remained a special place for him. although embarrassed by his poverty, he briefly dated a swazi woman before unsuccessfully courting his landlord's daughter. to save money and be closer to downtown johannesburg, mandela moved into the compound of the witwatersrand native labour association, living among miners of various tribes; as the compound was visited by various chiefs, he once met the queen regent of basutoland. in late 1941, jongintaba visited johannesburgâthere forgiving mandela for running awayâbefore returning to thembuland, where he died in the winter of 1942. mandela and justice arrived a day late for the funeral. after he passed his ba exams in early 1943, mandela returned to johannesburg to follow a political path as a lawyer rather than become a privy councillor in thembuland. he later stated that he experienced no epiphany, but that he ""simply found [himself] doing so, and could not do otherwise.""

mandela began studying law at the university of the witwatersrand, where he was the only black african student and faced racism. there, he befriended liberal and communist european, jewish, and indian students, among them joe slovo and ruth first. becoming increasingly politicised, in august 1943 mandela marched in support of a successful bus boycott to reverse fare rises. joining the anc, he was increasingly influenced by sisulu, spending time with other activists at sisulu's orlando house, including his old friend oliver tambo. in 1943, mandela met anton lembede, an anc member affiliated with the ""africanist"" branch of african nationalism, which was virulently opposed to a racially united front against colonialism and imperialism or to an alliance with the communists. despite his friendships with non-blacks and communists, mandela embraced lembede's views, believing that black africans should be entirely independent in their struggle for political self-determination. deciding on the need for a youth wing to mass-mobilise africans in opposition to their subjugation, mandela was among a delegation that approached anc president alfred bitini xuma on the subject at his home in sophiatown; the african national congress youth league (ancyl) was founded on easter sunday 1944 in the bantu men's social centre, with lembede as president and mandela as a member of its executive committee.

at sisulu's house, mandela met evelyn mase, a trainee nurse and anc activist from engcobo, transkei. entering a relationship and marrying in october 1944, they initially lived with her relatives until moving into a rented house in the township of orlando in early 1946. their first child, madiba ""thembi"" thembekile, was born in february 1945; a daughter, makaziwe, was born in 1947 but died of meningitis nine months later. mandela enjoyed home life, welcoming his mother and his sister, leabie, to stay with him. in early 1947, his three years of articles ended at witkin, sidelsky and eidelman, and he decided to become a full-time student, subsisting on loans from the bantu welfare trust.

in july 1947, mandela rushed lembede, who was ill, to hospital, where he died; he was succeeded as ancyl president by the more moderate peter mda, who agreed to co-operate with communists and non-blacks, appointing mandela ancyl secretary. mandela disagreed with mda's approach, and in december 1947 supported an unsuccessful measure to expel communists from the ancyl, considering their ideology un-african. in 1947, mandela was elected to the executive committee of the anc's transvaal province branch, serving under regional president c. s. ramohanoe. when ramohanoe acted against the wishes of the committee by co-operating with indians and communists, mandela was one of those who forced his resignation.

in the south african general election in 1948, in which only whites were permitted to vote, the afrikaner-dominated herenigde nasionale party under daniel franã§ois malan took power, soon uniting with the afrikaner party to form the national party. openly racialist, the party codified and expanded racial segregation with new apartheid legislation. gaining increasing influence in the anc, mandela and his party cadre allies began advocating direct action against apartheid, such as boycotts and strikes, influenced by the tactics already employed by south africa's indian community. xuma did not support these measures and was removed from the presidency in a vote of no confidence, replaced by james moroka and a more militant executive committee containing sisulu, mda, tambo, and godfrey pitje. mandela later related that he and his colleagues had ""guided the anc to a more radical and revolutionary path."" having devoted his time to politics, mandela failed his final year at witwatersrand three times; he was ultimately denied his degree in december 1949.

mandela took xuma's place on the anc national executive in march 1950, and that same year was elected national president of the ancyl. in march, the defend free speech convention was held in johannesburg, bringing together african, indian, and communist activists to call a may day general strike in protest against apartheid and white minority rule. mandela opposed the strike because it was multi-racial and not anc-led, but a majority of black workers took part, resulting in increased police repression and the introduction of the suppression of communism act, 1950, affecting the actions of all protest groups. at the anc national conference of december 1951, he continued arguing against a racially united front, but was outvoted.

thereafter, mandela rejected lembede's africanism and embraced the idea of a multi-racial front against apartheid. influenced by friends like moses kotane and by the soviet union's support for wars of national liberation, his mistrust of communism broke down and he began reading literature by karl marx, vladimir lenin, and mao zedong, eventually embracing the marxist philosophy of dialectical materialism. commenting on communism, he later stated that he ""found [himself] strongly drawn to the idea of a classless society which, to [his] mind, was similar to traditional african culture where life was shared and communal."" in april 1952, mandela began work at the h.m. basner law firm, which was owned by a communist, although his increasing commitment to work and activism meant he spent less time with his family.

in 1952, the anc began preparation for a joint defiance campaign against apartheid with indian and communist groups, founding a national voluntary board to recruit volunteers. the campaign was designed to follow the path of nonviolent resistance influenced by mahatma gandhi; some supported this for ethical reasons, but mandela instead considered it pragmatic. at a durban rally on 22 june, mandela addressed an assembled crowd of 10,000, initiating the campaign protests, for which he was arrested and briefly interned in marshall square prison. these events established mandela as one of the best-known black political figures in south africa. with further protests, the anc's membership grew from 20,000 to 100,000; the government responded with mass arrests and introduced the public safety act, 1953 to permit martial law. in may, authorities banned transvaal anc president j. b. marks from making public appearances; unable to maintain his position, he recommended mandela as his successor. although africanists opposed his candidacy, mandela was elected regional president in october.

in july 1952, mandela was arrested under the suppression of communism act and stood trial as one of the 21 accusedâamong them moroka, sisulu, and yusuf dadooâin johannesburg. found guilty of ""statutory communism"", a term that the government used to describe most opposition to apartheid, their sentence of nine months' hard labour was suspended for two years. in december, mandela was given a six-month ban from attending meetings or talking to more than one individual at a time, making his transvaal anc presidency impractical, and during this period the defiance campaign petered out. in september 1953, andrew kunene read out mandela's ""no easy walk to freedom"" speech at a transvaal anc meeting; the title was taken from a quote by indian independence leader jawaharlal nehru, a seminal influence on mandela's thought. the speech laid out a contingency plan for a scenario in which the anc was banned. this mandela plan, or m-plan, involved dividing the organisation into a cell structure with a more centralised leadership.

mandela obtained work as an attorney for the firm terblanche and briggish, before moving to the liberal-run helman and michel, passing qualification exams to become a full-fledged attorney. in august 1953, mandela and tambo opened their own law firm, mandela and tambo, operating in downtown johannesburg. the only african-run law firm in the country, it was popular with aggrieved blacks, often dealing with cases of police brutality. disliked by the authorities, the firm was forced to relocate to a remote location after their office permit was removed under the group areas act; as a result, their clientele dwindled. as a lawyer of aristocratic heritage, mandela was part of johannesburg's elite black middle-class, and accorded much respect from the black community. although a second daughter, makaziwe phumia, was born in may 1954, mandela's relationship with evelyn became strained, and she accused him of adultery. he may have had affairs with anc member lillian ngoyi and secretary ruth mompati; various individuals close to mandela in this period have stated that the latter bore him a child. disgusted by her son's behaviour, nosekeni returned to transkei, while evelyn embraced the jehovah's witnesses and rejected mandela's preoccupation with politics.

after taking part in the unsuccessful protest to prevent the forced relocation of all black people from the sophiatown suburb of johannesburg in february 1955, mandela concluded that violent action would prove necessary to end apartheid and white minority rule. on his advice, sisulu requested weaponry from the people's republic of china, which was denied. although the chinese government supported the anti-apartheid struggle, they believed the movement insufficiently prepared for guerrilla warfare. with the involvement of the south african indian congress, the coloured people's congress, the south african congress of trade unions and the congress of democrats, the anc planned a congress of the people, calling on all south africans to send in proposals for a post-apartheid era. based on the responses, a freedom charter was drafted by rusty bernstein, calling for the creation of a democratic, non-racialist state with the nationalisation of major industry. the charter was adopted at a june 1955 conference in kliptown; 3,000 delegates attended the event, which was forcibly closed down by police. the tenets of the freedom charter remained important for mandela, and in 1956 he described it as ""an inspiration to the people of south africa"".

following the end of a second ban in september 1955, mandela went on a working holiday to transkei to discuss the implications of the bantu authorities act, 1951 with local tribal leaders, also visiting his mother and noengland before proceeding to cape town. in march 1956 he received his third ban on public appearances, restricting him to johannesburg for five years, but he often defied it. mandela's marriage broke down and evelyn left him, taking their children to live with her brother. initiating divorce proceedings in may 1956, she claimed that mandela had physically abused her; he denied the allegations, and fought for custody of their children. she withdrew her petition of separation in november, but mandela filed for divorce in january 1958; the divorce was finalised in march, with the children placed in evelyn's care. during the divorce proceedings, he began courting a social worker, winnie madikizela, whom he married in bizana in june 1958. she later became involved in anc activities, spending several weeks in prison. together they had two children: zenani, born in february 1959, and zindziswa, born in december 1960.

in december 1956, mandela was arrested alongside most of the anc national executive, and accused of ""high treason"" against the state. held in johannesburg prison amid mass protests, they underwent a preparatory examination before being granted bail. the defence's refutation began in january 1957, overseen by defence lawyer vernon berrangã©, and continued until the case was adjourned in september. in january 1958, oswald pirow was appointed to prosecute the case, and in february the judge ruled that there was ""sufficient reason"" for the defendants to go on trial in the transvaal supreme court. the formal treason trial began in pretoria in august 1958, with the defendants successfully applying to have the three judgesâall linked to the governing national partyâreplaced. in august, one charge was dropped, and in october the prosecution withdrew its indictment, submitting a reformulated version in november which argued that the anc leadership committed high treason by advocating violent revolution, a charge the defendants denied.

in april 1959, africanists dissatisfied with the anc's united front approach founded the pan-africanist congress (pac); mandela disagreed with the pac's racially exclusionary views, describing them as ""immature"" and ""naã¯ve"". both parties took part in an anti-pass campaign in early 1960, in which africans burned the passes that they were legally obliged to carry. one of the pac-organised demonstrations was fired upon by police, resulting in the deaths of 69 protesters in the sharpeville massacre. the incident brought international condemnation of the government and resulted in rioting throughout south africa, with mandela publicly burning his pass in solidarity.

responding to the unrest, the government implemented state of emergency measures, declaring martial law and banning the anc and pac; in march, they arrested mandela and other activists, imprisoning them for five months without charge in the unsanitary conditions of the pretoria local prison. imprisonment caused problems for mandela and his co-defendants in the treason trial; their lawyers could not reach them, and so it was decided that the lawyers would withdraw in protest until the accused were freed from prison when the state of emergency was lifted in late august 1960. over the following months, mandela used his free time to organise an all-in african conference near pietermaritzburg, natal, in march 1961, at which 1,400 anti-apartheid delegates met, agreeing on a stay-at-home strike to mark 31 may, the day south africa became a republic. on 29 march 1961, six years after the treason trial began, the judges produced a verdict of not guilty, ruling that there was insufficient evidence to convict the accused of ""high treason"", since they had advocated neither communism nor violent revolution; the outcome embarrassed the government.

disguised as a chauffeur, mandela travelled around the country incognito, organising the anc's new cell structure and the planned mass stay-at-home strike. referred to as the ""black pimpernel"" in the pressâa reference to emma orczy's 1905 novel ""the scarlet pimpernel""âa warrant for his arrest was put out by the police. mandela held secret meetings with reporters, and after the government failed to prevent the strike, he warned them that many anti-apartheid activists would soon resort to violence through groups like the pac's poqo. he believed that the anc should form an armed group to channel some of this violence in a controlled direction, convincing both anc leader albert luthuliâwho was morally opposed to violenceâand allied activist groups of its necessity.

inspired by the actions of fidel castro's 26th of july movement in the cuban revolution, in 1961 mandela, sisulu, and slovo co-founded umkhonto we sizwe (""spear of the nation"", abbreviated mk). becoming chairman of the militant group, mandela gained ideas from literature on guerrilla warfare by marxist militants mao and che guevara as well as from the military theorist carl von clausewitz. although initially declared officially separate from the anc so as not to taint the latter's reputation, mk was later widely recognised as the party's armed wing. most early mk members were white communists who were able to conceal mandela in their homes; after hiding in communist wolfie kodesh's flat in berea, mandela moved to the communist-owned liliesleaf farm in rivonia, there joined by raymond mhlaba, slovo, and bernstein, who put together the mk constitution. although in later life mandela denied, for political reasons, ever being a member of the communist party, historical research published in 2011 strongly suggested that he had joined in the late 1950s or early 1960s. this was confirmed by both the sacp and the anc after mandela's death. according to the sacp, he was not only a member of the party, but also served on its central committee.

operating through a cell structure, mk planned to carry out acts of sabotage that would exert maximum pressure on the government with minimum casualties; they sought to bomb military installations, power plants, telephone lines, and transport links at night, when civilians were not present. mandela stated that they chose sabotage because it was the least harmful action, did not involve killing, and offered the best hope for racial reconciliation afterwards; he nevertheless acknowledged that should this have failed then guerrilla warfare might have been necessary. soon after anc leader luthuli was awarded the nobel peace prize, mk publicly announced its existence with 57 bombings on dingane's day (16 december) 1961, followed by further attacks on new year's eve.

the anc decided to send mandela as a delegate to the february 1962 meeting of the pan-african freedom movement for east, central and southern africa (pafmecsa) in addis ababa, ethiopia. leaving south africa in secret via bechuanaland, on his way mandela visited tanganyika and met with its president, julius nyerere. arriving in ethiopia, mandela met with emperor haile selassie i, and gave his speech after selassie's at the conference. after the symposium, he travelled to cairo, egypt, admiring the political reforms of president gamal abdel nasser, and then went to tunis, tunisia, where president habib bourguiba gave him â£5,000 for weaponry. he proceeded to morocco, mali, guinea, sierra leone, liberia, and senegal, receiving funds from liberian president william tubman and guinean president ahmed sã©kou tourã©. he left africa for london, england, where he met anti-apartheid activists, reporters, and prominent politicians. upon returning to ethiopia, he began a six-month course in guerrilla warfare, but completed only two months before being recalled to south africa by the anc's leadership.

on 5 august 1962, police captured mandela along with fellow activist cecil williams near howick. many mk members suspected that the authorities had been tipped off with regard to mandela's whereabouts, although mandela himself gave these ideas little credence. in later years, donald rickard, a former american diplomat revealed that the central intelligence agency, who feared mandela's associations with communists, had informed the south african police of his location. jailed in johannesburg's marshall square prison, mandela was charged with inciting workers' strikes and leaving the country without permission. representing himself with slovo as legal advisor, mandela intended to use the trial to showcase ""the anc's moral opposition to racism"" while supporters demonstrated outside the court. moved to pretoria, where winnie could visit him, he began correspondence studies for a bachelor of laws (llb) degree from the university of london international programmes. his hearing began in october, but he disrupted proceedings by wearing a traditional ""kaross"", refusing to call any witnesses, and turning his plea of mitigation into a political speech. found guilty, he was sentenced to five years' imprisonment; as he left the courtroom, supporters sang ""nkosi sikelel iafrika"".

on 11 july 1963, police raided liliesleaf farm, arresting those they found there and uncovering paperwork documenting mk's activities, some of which mentioned mandela. the rivonia trial began at pretoria supreme court in october, with mandela and his comrades charged with four counts of sabotage and conspiracy to violently overthrow the government; their chief prosecutor was percy yutar. judge quartus de wet soon threw out the prosecution's case for insufficient evidence, but yutar reformulated the charges, presenting his new case from december 1963 until february 1964, calling 173 witnesses and bringing thousands of documents and photographs to the trial.

although four of the accused denied involvement with mk, mandela and the other five accused admitted sabotage but denied that they had ever agreed to initiate guerrilla war against the government. they used the trial to highlight their political cause; at the opening of the defence's proceedings, mandela gave his three-hour ""i am prepared to die"" speech. that speechâwhich was inspired by castro's ""history will absolve me""âwas widely reported in the press despite official censorship. the trial gained international attention; there were global calls for the release of the accused from the united nations and world peace council, while the university of london union voted mandela to its presidency. on 12 june 1964, justice de wet found mandela and two of his co-accused guilty on all four charges; although the prosecution had called for the death sentence to be applied, the judge instead condemned them to life imprisonment.

mandela and his co-accused were transferred from pretoria to the prison on robben island, remaining there for the next 18 years. isolated from non-political prisoners in section b, mandela was imprisoned in a damp concrete cell measuring by , with a straw mat on which to sleep. verbally and physically harassed by several white prison wardens, the rivonia trial prisoners spent their days breaking rocks into gravel, until being reassigned in january 1965 to work in a lime quarry. mandela was initially forbidden to wear sunglasses, and the glare from the lime permanently damaged his eyesight. at night, he worked on his llb degree which he was obtaining from the university of london through a correspondence course with wolsey hall, oxford, but newspapers were forbidden, and he was locked in solitary confinement on several occasions for the possession of smuggled news clippings. he was initially classified as the lowest grade of prisoner, class d, meaning that he was permitted one visit and one letter every six months, although all mail was heavily censored.

the political prisoners took part in work and hunger strikesâthe latter considered largely ineffective by mandelaâto improve prison conditions, viewing this as a microcosm of the anti-apartheid struggle. anc prisoners elected him to their four-man ""high organ"" along with sisulu, govan mbeki, and raymond mhlaba, and he involved himself in a group representing all political prisoners (including eddie daniels) on the island, ulundi, through which he forged links with pac and yu chi chan club members. initiating the ""university of robben island"", whereby prisoners lectured on their own areas of expertise, he debated socio-political topics with his comrades.

though attending christian sunday services, mandela studied islam. he also studied afrikaans, hoping to build a mutual respect with the warders and convert them to his cause. various official visitors met with mandela, most significantly the liberal parliamentary representative helen suzman of the progressive party, who championed mandela's cause outside of prison. in september 1970, he met british labour party politician dennis healey. south african minister of justice jimmy kruger visited in december 1974, but he and mandela did not get along with each other. his mother visited in 1968, dying shortly after, and his firstborn son thembi died in a car accident the following year; mandela was forbidden from attending either funeral. his wife was rarely able to see him, being regularly imprisoned for political activity, and his daughters first visited in december 1975. winnie was released from prison in 1977 but was forcibly settled in brandfort and remained unable to see him.

from 1967 onwards, prison conditions improved; black prisoners were given trousers rather than shorts, games were permitted, and the standard of their food was raised. in 1969, an escape plan for mandela was developed by gordon bruce, but it was abandoned after the conspiracy was infiltrated by an agent of the south african bureau of state security (boss), who hoped to see mandela shot during the escape. in 1970, commander piet badenhorst became commanding officer. mandela, seeing an increase in the physical and mental abuse of prisoners, complained to visiting judges, who had badenhorst reassigned. he was replaced by commander willie willemse, who developed a co-operative relationship with mandela and was keen to improve prison standards.

by 1975, mandela had become a class a prisoner, which allowed him greater numbers of visits and letters. he corresponded with anti-apartheid activists like mangosuthu buthelezi and desmond tutu. that year, he began his autobiography, which was smuggled to london, but remained unpublished at the time; prison authorities discovered several pages, and his llb study privileges were revoked for four years. instead, he devoted his spare time to gardening and reading until the authorities permitted him to resume his llb degree studies in 1980.

by the late 1960s, mandela's fame had been eclipsed by steve biko and the black consciousness movement (bcm). seeing the anc as ineffectual, the bcm called for militant action, but following the soweto uprising of 1976, many bcm activists were imprisoned on robben island. mandela tried to build a relationship with these young radicals, although he was critical of their racialism and contempt for white anti-apartheid activists. renewed international interest in his plight came in july 1978, when he celebrated his 60th birthday. he was awarded an honorary doctorate in lesotho, the jawaharlal nehru award for international understanding in india in 1979, and the freedom of the city of glasgow, scotland in 1981. in march 1980, the slogan ""free mandela!"" was developed by journalist percy qoboza, sparking an international campaign that led the un security council to call for his release. despite increasing foreign pressure, the government refused, relying on its cold war allies us president ronald reagan and uk prime minister margaret thatcher; both considered mandela's anc a terrorist organisation sympathetic to communism, and supported its suppression.

in april 1982, mandela was transferred to pollsmoor prison in tokai, cape town, along with senior anc leaders walter sisulu, andrew mlangeni, ahmed kathrada, and raymond mhlaba; they believed that they were being isolated to remove their influence on younger activists at robben island. conditions at pollsmoor were better than at robben island, although mandela missed the camaraderie and scenery of the island. getting on well with pollsmoor's commanding officer, brigadier munro, mandela was permitted to create a roof garden; he also read voraciously and corresponded widely, now permitted 52 letters a year. he was appointed patron of the multi-racial united democratic front (udf), founded to combat reforms implemented by south african president p. w. botha. botha's national party government had permitted coloured and indian citizens to vote for their own parliaments, which had control over education, health, and housing, but black africans were excluded from the system; like mandela, the udf saw this as an attempt to divide the anti-apartheid movement on racial lines.

the early 1980s witnessed an escalation of violence across the country, and many predicted civil war. this was accompanied by economic stagnation as various multinational banksâunder pressure from an international lobbyâhad stopped investing in south africa. numerous banks and thatcher asked botha to release mandelaâthen at the height of his international fameâto defuse the volatile situation. although considering mandela a dangerous ""arch-marxist"", in february 1985 botha offered him a release from prison if he ""unconditionally rejected violence as a political weapon"". mandela spurned the offer, releasing a statement through his daughter zindzi stating, ""what freedom am i being offered while the organisation of the people [anc] remains banned? only free men can negotiate. a prisoner cannot enter into contracts.""

in 1985, mandela underwent surgery on an enlarged prostate gland, before being given new solitary quarters on the ground floor. he was met by ""seven eminent persons"", an international delegation sent to negotiate a settlement, but botha's government refused to co-operate, calling a state of emergency in june and initiating a police crackdown on unrest. the anti-apartheid resistance fought back, with the anc committing 231 attacks in 1986 and 235 in 1987. the violence escalated as the government used the army and police to combat the resistance, and provided covert support for vigilante groups and the zulu nationalist movement inkatha, which was involved in an increasingly violent struggle with the anc. mandela requested talks with botha but was denied, instead secretly meeting with minister of justice kobie coetsee in 1987, and having a further 11 meetings over the next three years. coetsee organised negotiations between mandela and a team of four government figures starting in may 1988; the team agreed to the release of political prisoners and the legalisation of the anc on the condition that they permanently renounce violence, break links with the communist party, and not insist on majority rule. mandela rejected these conditions, insisting that the anc would end its armed activities only when the government renounced violence.

mandela's 70th birthday in july 1988 attracted international attention, including a tribute concert at london's wembley stadium that was televised and watched by an estimated 200 million viewers. although presented globally as a heroic figure, he faced personal problems when anc leaders informed him that winnie had set herself up as head of a gang, the ""mandela united football club"", which had been responsible for torturing and killing opponentsâincluding childrenâin soweto. though some encouraged him to divorce her, he decided to remain loyal until she was found guilty by trial.

recovering from tuberculosis exacerbated by the damp conditions in his cell, in december 1988 mandela was moved to victor verster prison near paarl. he was housed in the relative comfort of a warder's house with a personal cook, and used the time to complete his llb degree. while there, he was permitted many visitors and organised secret communications with exiled anc leader oliver tambo.

in 1989, botha suffered a stroke; although he would retain the state presidency, he stepped down as leader of the national party, to be replaced by f. w. de klerk. in a surprise move, botha invited mandela to a meeting over tea in july 1989, an invitation mandela considered genial. botha was replaced as state president by de klerk six weeks later; the new president believed that apartheid was unsustainable and released a number of anc prisoners. following the fall of the berlin wall in november 1989, de klerk called his cabinet together to debate legalising the anc and freeing mandela. although some were deeply opposed to his plans, de klerk met with mandela in december to discuss the situation, a meeting both men considered friendly, before legalising all formerly banned political parties in february 1990 and announcing mandela's unconditional release. shortly thereafter, for the first time in 20 years, photographs of mandela were allowed to be published in south africa.

leaving victor verster prison on 11 february, mandela held winnie's hand in front of amassed crowds and the press; the event was broadcast live across the world. driven to cape town's city hall through crowds, he gave a speech declaring his commitment to peace and reconciliation with the white minority, but made it clear that the anc's armed struggle was not over, and would continue as ""a purely defensive action against the violence of apartheid"". he expressed hope that the government would agree to negotiations, so that ""there may no longer be the need for the armed struggle"", and insisted that his main focus was to bring peace to the black majority and give them the right to vote in national and local elections. staying at tutu's home, in the following days mandela met with friends, activists, and press, giving a speech to an estimated 100,000 people at johannesburg's soccer city.

mandela proceeded on an african tour, meeting supporters and politicians in zambia, zimbabwe, namibia, libya and algeria, and continuing to sweden, where he was reunited with tambo, and london, where he appeared at the concert at wembley stadium in wembley park. encouraging foreign countries to support sanctions against the apartheid government, in france he was welcomed by president franã§ois mitterrand, in vatican city by pope john paul ii, and in the united kingdom by thatcher. in the united states, he met president george h.w. bush, addressed both houses of congress and visited eight cities, being particularly popular among the african-american community. in cuba, he became friends with president castro, whom he had long admired. he met president r. venkataraman in india, president suharto in indonesia, prime minister mahathir mohamad in malaysia, and prime minister bob hawke in australia. he visited japan, but not the soviet union, a longtime anc supporter.

in may 1990, mandela led a multiracial anc delegation into preliminary negotiations with a government delegation of 11 afrikaner men. mandela impressed them with his discussions of afrikaner history, and the negotiations led to the groot schuur minute, in which the government lifted the state of emergency. in august, mandelaârecognising the anc's severe military disadvantageâoffered a ceasefire, the pretoria minute, for which he was widely criticised by mk activists. he spent much time trying to unify and build the anc, appearing at a johannesburg conference in december attended by 1600 delegates, many of whom found him more moderate than expected. at the anc's july 1991 national conference in durban, mandela admitted that the party had faults and announced his aim to build a ""strong and well-oiled task force"" for securing majority rule. at the conference, he was elected anc president, replacing the ailing tambo, and a 50-strong multiracial, mixed gendered national executive was elected.

mandela was given an office in the newly purchased anc headquarters at shell house, johannesburg, and moved into winnie's large soweto home. their marriage was increasingly strained as he learned of her affair with dali mpofu, but he supported her during her trial for kidnapping and assault. he gained funding for her defence from the international defence and aid fund for southern africa and from libyan leader muammar gaddafi, but in june 1991 she was found guilty and sentenced to six years in prison, reduced to two on appeal. on 13 april 1992, mandela publicly announced his separation from winnie. the anc forced her to step down from the national executive for misappropriating anc funds; mandela moved into the mostly white johannesburg suburb of houghton. mandela's prospects for a peaceful transition were further damaged by an increase in ""black-on-black"" violence, particularly between anc and inkatha supporters in kwazulu-natal, which resulted in thousands of deaths. mandela met with inkatha leader buthelezi, but the anc prevented further negotiations on the issue. mandela argued that there was a ""third force"" within the state intelligence services fuelling the ""slaughter of the people"" and openly blamed de klerkâwhom he increasingly distrustedâfor the sebokeng massacre. in september 1991, a national peace conference was held in johannesburg at which mandela, buthelezi and de klerk signed a peace accord, though the violence continued.

the convention for a democratic south africa (codesa) began in december 1991 at the johannesburg world trade centre, attended by 228 delegates from 19 political parties. although cyril ramaphosa led the anc's delegation, mandela remained a key figure, and after de klerk used the closing speech to condemn the anc's violence, he took to the stage to denounce de klerk as the ""head of an illegitimate, discredited minority regime"". dominated by the national party and anc, little negotiation was achieved. codesa 2 was held in may 1992, at which de klerk insisted that post-apartheid south africa must use a federal system with a rotating presidency to ensure the protection of ethnic minorities; mandela opposed this, demanding a unitary system governed by majority rule. following the boipatong massacre of anc activists by government-aided inkatha militants, mandela called off the negotiations, before attending a meeting of the organisation of african unity in senegal, at which he called for a special session of the un security council and proposed that a un peacekeeping force be stationed in south africa to prevent ""state terrorism"". calling for domestic mass action, in august the anc organised the largest-ever strike in south african history, and supporters marched on pretoria.

following the bisho massacre, in which 28 anc supporters and one soldier were shot dead by the ciskei defence force during a protest march, mandela realised that mass action was leading to further violence and resumed negotiations in september. he agreed to do so on the conditions that all political prisoners be released, that zulu traditional weapons be banned, and that zulu hostels would be fenced off, the latter two measures intended to prevent further inkatha attacks; de klerk reluctantly agreed. the negotiations agreed that a multiracial general election would be held, resulting in a five-year coalition government of national unity and a constitutional assembly that gave the national party continuing influence. the anc also conceded to safeguarding the jobs of white civil servants; such concessions brought fierce internal criticism. the duo agreed on an interim constitution based on a liberal democratic model, guaranteeing separation of powers, creating a constitutional court, and including a us-style bill of rights; it also divided the country into nine provinces, each with its own premier and civil service, a concession between de klerk's desire for federalism and mandela's for unitary government.

the democratic process was threatened by the concerned south africans group (cosag), an alliance of black ethnic-secessionist groups like inkatha and far-right afrikaner parties; in june 1993, one of the latterâthe afrikaner weerstandsbeweging (awb)âattacked the kempton park world trade centre. following the murder of anc activist chris hani, mandela made a publicised speech to calm rioting, soon after appearing at a mass funeral in soweto for tambo, who had died of a stroke. in july 1993, both mandela and de klerk visited the us, independently meeting president bill clinton and each receiving the liberty medal. soon after, mandela and de klerk were jointly awarded the nobel peace prize in norway. influenced by thabo mbeki, mandela began meeting with big business figures, and played down his support for nationalisation, fearing that he would scare away much-needed foreign investment. although criticised by socialist anc members, he had been encouraged to embrace private enterprise by members of the chinese and vietnamese communist parties at the january 1992 world economic forum in switzerland.

with the election set for 27 april 1994, the anc began campaigning, opening 100 election offices and orchestrating people's forums across the country at which mandela could appear, as a popular figure with great status among black south africans. the anc campaigned on a reconstruction and development programme (rdp) to build a million houses in five years, introduce universal free education and extend access to water and electricity. the party's slogan was ""a better life for all"", although it was not explained how this development would be funded. with the exception of the ""weekly mail"" and the ""new nation"", south africa's press opposed mandela's election, fearing continued ethnic strife, instead supporting the national or democratic party. mandela devoted much time to fundraising for the anc, touring north america, europe and asia to meet wealthy donors, including former supporters of the apartheid regime. he also urged a reduction in the voting age from 18 to 14; rejected by the anc, this policy became the subject of ridicule.

concerned that cosag would undermine the election, particularly in the wake of the conflict in bophuthatswana and the shell house massacreâincidents of violence involving the awb and inkatha, respectivelyâmandela met with afrikaner politicians and generals, including p. w. botha, pik botha and constand viljoen, persuading many to work within the democratic system. with de klerk, he also convinced inkatha's buthelezi to enter the elections rather than launch a war of secession. as leaders of the two major parties, de klerk and mandela appeared on a televised debate; although de klerk was widely considered the better speaker at the event, mandela's offer to shake his hand surprised him, leading some commentators to deem it a victory for mandela. the election went ahead with little violence, although an awb cell killed 20 with car bombs. as widely expected, the anc won a sweeping victory, taking 63% of the vote, just short of the two-thirds majority needed to unilaterally change the constitution. the anc was also victorious in seven provinces, with inkatha and the national party each taking another. mandela voted at the ohlange high school in durban, and though the anc's victory assured his election as president, he publicly accepted that the election had been marred by instances of fraud and sabotage.

the newly elected national assembly's first act was to formally elect mandela as south africa's first black chief executive. his inauguration took place in pretoria on 10 may 1994, televised to a billion viewers globally. the event was attended by four thousand guests, including world leaders from a wide range of geographic and ideological backgrounds. mandela headed a government of national unity dominated by the ancâwhich had no experience of governing by itselfâbut containing representatives from the national party and inkatha. under the interim constitution, inkatha and the national party were entitled to seats in the government by virtue of winning at least 20 seats. in keeping with earlier agreements, both de klerk and thabo mbeki were given the position of deputy president. although mbeki had not been his first choice for the job, mandela grew to rely heavily on him throughout his presidency, allowing him to shape policy details. moving into the presidential office at tuynhuys in cape town, mandela allowed de klerk to retain the presidential residence in the groote schuur estate, instead settling into the nearby westbrooke manor, which he renamed ""genadendal"", meaning ""valley of mercy"" in afrikaans. retaining his houghton home, he also had a house built in his home village of qunu, which he visited regularly, walking around the area, meeting with locals, and judging tribal disputes.

aged 76, he faced various ailments, and although exhibiting continued energy, he felt isolated and lonely. he often entertained celebrities, such as michael jackson, whoopi goldberg, and the spice girls, and befriended ultra-rich businessmen, like harry oppenheimer of anglo-american. he also met with queen elizabeth ii on her march 1995 state visit to south africa, which earned him strong criticism from anc anti-capitalists. despite his opulent surroundings, mandela lived simply, donating a third of his r 552,000 annual income to the nelson mandela children's fund, which he had founded in 1995. although dismantling press censorship, speaking out in favour of freedom of the press, and befriending many journalists, mandela was critical of much of the country's media, noting that it was overwhelmingly owned and run by middle-class whites and believing that it focused too heavily on scaremongering about crime.

in december 1994, mandela published ""long walk to freedom"", an autobiography based around a manuscript he had written in prison, augmented by interviews conducted with american journalist richard stengel. in late 1994, he attended the 49th conference of the anc in bloemfontein, at which a more militant national executive was elected, among them winnie mandela; although she expressed an interest in reconciling, nelson initiated divorce proceedings in august 1995. by 1995, he had entered into a relationship with graã§a machel, a mozambican political activist 27 years his junior who was the widow of former president samora machel. they had first met in july 1990 when she was still in mourning, but their friendship grew into a partnership, with machel accompanying him on many of his foreign visits. she turned down mandela's first marriage proposal, wanting to retain some independence and dividing her time between mozambique and johannesburg.

presiding over the transition from apartheid minority rule to a multicultural democracy, mandela saw national reconciliation as the primary task of his presidency. having seen other post-colonial african economies damaged by the departure of white elites, mandela worked to reassure south africa's white population that they were protected and represented in ""the rainbow nation"". although his government of national unity would be dominated by the anc, he attempted to create a broad coalition by appointing de klerk as deputy president and appointing other national party officials as ministers for agriculture, energy, environment, and minerals and energy, as well as naming buthelezi as minister for home affairs. the other cabinet positions were taken by anc members, many of whomâlike joe modise, alfred nzo, joe slovo, mac maharaj and dullah omarâhad long been comrades of mandela, although others, such as tito mboweni and jeff radebe, were far younger. mandela's relationship with de klerk was strained; mandela thought that de klerk was intentionally provocative, and de klerk felt that he was being intentionally humiliated by the president. in january 1995, mandela heavily chastised him for awarding amnesty to 3,500 police officers just before the election, and later criticised him for defending former minister of defence magnus malan when the latter was charged with murder.

mandela personally met with senior figures of the apartheid regime, including hendrik verwoerd's widow, betsie schoombie, and lawyer percy yutar, also laying a wreath by the statue of afrikaner hero daniel theron. emphasising personal forgiveness and reconciliation, he announced that ""courageous people do not fear forgiving, for the sake of peace."" he encouraged black south africans to get behind the previously hated national rugby team, the springboks, as south africa hosted the 1995 rugby world cup. mandela wore a springbok shirt at the final against new zealand, and after the springboks won the match, mandela presented the trophy to captain francois pienaar, an afrikaner. this was widely seen as a major step in the reconciliation of white and black south africans; as de klerk later put it, ""mandela won the hearts of millions of white rugby fans."" mandela's efforts at reconciliation assuaged the fears of whites, but also drew criticism from more militant blacks. among the latter was his estranged wife, winnie, who accused the anc of being more interested in appeasing the white community than in helping the black majority.

mandela oversaw the formation of a truth and reconciliation commission to investigate crimes committed under apartheid by both the government and the anc, appointing tutu as its chair. to prevent the creation of martyrs, the commission granted individual amnesties in exchange for testimony of crimes committed during the apartheid era. dedicated in february 1996, it held two years of hearings detailing rapes, torture, bombings, and assassinations, before issuing its final report in october 1998. both de klerk and mbeki appealed to have parts of the report suppressed, though only de klerk's appeal was successful. mandela praised the commission's work, stating that it ""had helped us move away from the past to concentrate on the present and the future"".

mandela's administration inherited a country with a huge disparity in wealth and services between white and black communities. of a population of 40 million, around 23â million lacked electricity or adequate sanitation, and 12â million lacked clean water supplies, with 2â million children not in school and a third of the population illiterate. there was 33% unemployment, and just under half of the population lived below the poverty line. government financial reserves were nearly depleted, with a fifth of the national budget being spent on debt repayment, meaning that the extent of the promised reconstruction and development programme (rdp) was scaled back, with none of the proposed nationalisation or job creation. in 1996, the rdp was replaced with a new policy, growth, employment and redistribution (gear), which maintained south africa's mixed economy but placed an emphasis on economic growth through a framework of market economics and the encouragement of foreign investment; many in the anc derided it as a neo-liberal policy that did not address social inequality, no matter how mandela defended it. in adopting this approach, mandela's government adhered to the ""washington consensus"" advocated by the world bank and international monetary fund.

under mandela's presidency, welfare spending increased by 13% in 1996/97, 13% in 1997/98, and 7% in 1998/99. the government introduced parity in grants for communities, including disability grants, child maintenance grants, and old-age pensions, which had previously been set at different levels for south africa's different racial groups. in 1994, free healthcare was introduced for children under six and pregnant women, a provision extended to all those using primary level public sector health care services in 1996. by the 1999 election, the anc could boast that due to their policies, 3 million people were connected to telephone lines, 1.5â million children were brought into the education system, 500 clinics were upgraded or constructed, 2â million people were connected to the electricity grid, water access was extended to 3â million people, and 750,000 houses were constructed, housing nearly 3â million people.

the land reform act 3 of 1996 safeguarded the rights of labour tenants living on farms where they grew crops or grazed livestock. this legislation ensured that such tenants could not be evicted without a court order or if they were over the age of 65. recognising that arms manufacturing was a key industry for the south african economy, mandela endorsed the trade in weapons but brought in tighter regulations surrounding armscor to ensure that south african weaponry was not sold to authoritarian regimes. under mandela's administration, tourism was increasingly promoted, becoming a major sector of the south african economy.

critics like edwin cameron accused mandela's government of doing little to stem the hiv/aids pandemic in the country; by 1999, 10% of south africa's population were hiv positive. mandela later admitted that he had personally neglected the issue, in part due to public reticence in discussing issues surrounding sex in south africa, and that he had instead left the issue for mbeki to deal with. mandela also received criticism for failing to sufficiently combat crime; south africa had one of the world's highest crime rates, and the activities of international crime syndicates in the country grew significantly throughout the decade. mandela's administration was also perceived as having failed to deal with the problem of corruption.

further problems were caused by the exodus of thousands of skilled white south africans from the country, who were escaping the increasing crime rates, higher taxes, and the impact of positive discrimination toward blacks in employment. this exodus resulted in a brain drain, and mandela criticised those who left. at the same time, south africa experienced an influx of millions of illegal migrants from poorer parts of africa; although public opinion toward these illegal immigrants was generally unfavourable, characterising them as disease-spreading criminals who were a drain on resources, mandela called on south africans to embrace them as ""brothers and sisters"".

mandela expressed the view that ""south africa's future foreign relations [should] be based on our belief that human rights should be the core of international relations"". following the south african example, mandela encouraged other nations to resolve conflicts through diplomacy and reconciliation. in september 1998, mandela was appointed secretary-general of the non-aligned movement, who held their annual conference in durban. he used the event to criticise the ""narrow, chauvinistic interests"" of the israeli government in stalling negotiations to end the israeliâpalestinian conflict and urged india and pakistan to negotiate to end the kashmir conflict, for which he was criticised by both israel and india. inspired by the region's economic boom, mandela sought greater economic relations with east asia, in particular with malaysia, although this was prevented by the 1997 asian financial crisis. he extended diplomatic recognition to the people's republic of china (prc), who were growing as an economic force, and initially also to taiwan, who were already longstanding investors in the south african economy. however, under pressure from the prc, in november 1996 he cut recognition of taiwan, and in may 1999 paid an official visit to beijing.

mandela attracted controversy for his close relationship with indonesian president suharto, whose regime was responsible for mass human rights abuses, although on a july 1997 visit to indonesia he privately urged suharto to withdraw from the occupation of east timor. he also faced similar criticism from the west for his government's trade links to syria, cuba, and libya, and for his personal friendships with castro and gaddafi. castro visited in 1998 to widespread popular acclaim, and mandela met gaddafi in libya to award him the order of good hope. when western governments and media criticised these visits, mandela lambasted such criticism as having racist undertones, and stated that ""the enemies of countries in the west are not our enemies."" mandela hoped to resolve the long-running dispute between libya and the us and britain over bringing to trial the two libyans, abdelbaset al-megrahi and lamin khalifah fhimah, who were indicted in november 1991 and accused of sabotaging pan am flight 103. mandela proposed that they be tried in a third country, which was agreed to by all parties; governed by scots law, the trial was held at camp zeist in the netherlands in april 1999, and found one of the two men guilty.

mandela echoed mbeki's calls for an ""african renaissance"", and was greatly concerned with issues on the continent. he took a soft diplomatic approach to removing sani abacha's military junta in nigeria but later became a leading figure in calling for sanctions when abacha's regime increased human rights violations. in 1996, he was appointed chairman of the southern african development community (sadc) and initiated unsuccessful negotiations to end the first congo war in zaire. he also played a key role as a mediator in the ethnic conflict between tutsi and hutu political groups in the burundian civil war, helping to initiate a settlement which brought increased stability to the country but did not end the ethnic violence. in south africa's first post-apartheid military operation, troops were ordered in september 1998 into lesotho to protect the government of prime minister pakalitha mosisili after a disputed election prompted opposition uprisings. the action was not authorised by mandela himself, who was out of the country at the time, but by buthelezi, who was serving as acting president during mandela's absence.

the new constitution of south africa was agreed upon by parliament in may 1996, enshrining a series of institutions to place checks on political and administrative authority within a constitutional democracy. de klerk opposed the implementation of this constitution, and that month he and the national party withdrew from the coalition government in protest, claiming that the anc were not treating them as equals. the anc took over the cabinet positions formerly held by the nationalists, with mbeki becoming sole deputy president. inkatha remained part of the coalition, and when both mandela and mbeki were out of the country in september 1998, buthelezi was appointed ""acting president"", marking an improvement in his relationship with mandela. although mandela had often governed decisively in his first two years as president, he had subsequently increasingly delegated duties to mbeki, retaining only a close personal supervision of intelligence and security measures. during a 1997 visit to london, he said that ""the ruler of south africa, the ""de facto"" ruler, is thabo mbeki"" and that he was ""shifting everything to him"".

mandela stepped down as anc president at the party's december 1997 conference. he hoped that ramaphosa would succeed him, believing mbeki to be too inflexible and intolerant of criticism, but the anc elected mbeki regardless. mandela and the executive supported jacob zuma, a zulu who had been imprisoned on robben island, as mbeki's replacement for deputy president. zuma's candidacy was challenged by winnie, whose populist rhetoric had gained her a strong following within the party, although zuma defeated her in a landslide victory vote at the election.

mandela's relationship with machel had intensified; in february 1998, he publicly stated that he was ""in love with a remarkable lady"", and under pressure from tutu, who urged him to set an example for young people, he organised a wedding for his 80th birthday, in july that year. the following day, he held a grand party with many foreign dignitaries. although the 1996 constitution allowed the president to serve two consecutive five-year terms, mandela had never planned to stand for a second term in office. he gave his farewell speech to parliament on 29 march 1999 when it adjourned prior to the 1999 general elections, after which he retired. although opinion polls in south africa showed wavering support for both the anc and the government, mandela himself remained highly popular, with 80% of south africans polled in 1999 expressing satisfaction with his performance as president.

retiring in june 1999, mandela aimed to lead a quiet family life, divided between johannesburg and qunu. although he set about authoring a sequel to his first autobiography, to be titled ""the presidential years"", it was abandoned before publication. mandela found such seclusion difficult and reverted to a busy public life involving daily programme of tasks, meetings with world leaders and celebrities, andâwhen in johannesburgâworking with the nelson mandela foundation, founded in 1999 to focus on rural development, school construction, and combating hiv/aids. although he had been heavily criticised for failing to do enough to fight the hiv/aids pandemic during his presidency, he devoted much of his time to the issue following his retirement, describing it as ""a war"" that had killed more than ""all previous wars""; affiliating himself with the treatment action campaign, he urged mbeki's government to ensure that hiv-positive south africans had access to anti-retrovirals. meanwhile, mandela was successfully treated for prostate cancer in july 2001.

in 2002, mandela inaugurated the nelson mandela annual lecture, and in 2003 the mandela rhodes foundation was created at rhodes house, university of oxford, to provide postgraduate scholarships to african students. these projects were followed by the nelson mandela centre of memory and the 46664 campaign against hiv/aids. he gave the closing address at the xiii international aids conference in durban in 2000, and in 2004, spoke at the xv international aids conference in bangkok, thailand, calling for greater measures to tackle tuberculosis as well as hiv/aids. mandela publicised aids as the cause of his son makgatho's death in january 2005, to defy the stigma about discussing the disease.

publicly, mandela became more vocal in criticising western powers. he strongly opposed the 1999 nato intervention in kosovo and called it an attempt by the world's powerful nations to police the entire world. in 2003, he spoke out against the plans for the us and uk to launch a war in iraq, describing it as ""a tragedy"" and lambasting us president george w. bush and uk prime minister tony blair for undermining the un, saying, ""all that (mr. bush) wants is iraqi oil"". he attacked the us more generally, asserting that it had committed more ""unspeakable atrocities"" across the world than any other nation, citing the atomic bombing of japan; this attracted international controversy, although he later improved his relationship with blair. retaining an interest in libyan-uk relations, he visited megrahi in barlinnie prison and spoke out against the conditions of his treatment, referring to them as ""psychological persecution"".

in june 2004, aged 85 and amid failing health, mandela announced that he was ""retiring from retirement"" and retreating from public life, remarking, ""don't call me, i will call you."" although continuing to meet with close friends and family, the foundation discouraged invitations for him to appear at public events and denied most interview requests.

he retained some involvement in international affairs. in 2005, he founded the nelson mandela legacy trust, travelling to the us to speak before the brookings institution and the naacp on the need for economic assistance to africa. he spoke with us senator hillary clinton and president george w. bush and first met the then-senator barack obama. mandela also encouraged zimbabwean president robert mugabe to resign over growing human rights abuses in the country. when this proved ineffective, he spoke out publicly against mugabe in 2007, asking him to step down ""with residual respect and a modicum of dignity."" that year, mandela, machel, and desmond tutu convened a group of world leaders in johannesburg to contribute their wisdom and independent leadership to some of the world's toughest problems. mandela announced the formation of this new group, the elders, in a speech delivered on his 89th birthday.

mandela's 90th birthday was marked across the country on 18 july 2008, with the main celebrations held at qunu, and a concert in his honour in hyde park, london. in a speech marking the event, mandela called for the rich to help the poor across the world. throughout mbeki's presidency, mandela continued to support the anc, usually overshadowing mbeki at any public events that the two attended. mandela was more at ease with mbeki's successor, zuma, although the nelson mandela foundation was upset when his grandson, mandla mandela, flew him out to the eastern cape to attend a pro-zuma rally in the midst of a storm in 2009.

in 2004, mandela successfully campaigned for south africa to host the 2010 fifa world cup, declaring that there would be ""few better gifts for us"" in the year marking a decade since the fall of apartheid. despite maintaining a low profile during the event due to ill-health, mandela made his final public appearance during the world cup closing ceremony, where he received much applause. between 2005 and 2013, mandela, and later his family, were embroiled in a series of legal disputes regarding money held in family trusts for the benefit of his descendants. in mid-2013, as mandela was hospitalised for a lung infection in pretoria, his descendants were involved in an intra-family legal dispute relating to the burial place of mandela's children, and ultimately mandela himself.

in february 2011, mandela was briefly hospitalised with a respiratory infection, attracting international attention, before being re-admitted for a lung infection and gallstone removal in december 2012. after a successful medical procedure in early march 2013, his lung infection recurred and he was briefly hospitalised in pretoria. in june 2013, his lung infection worsened and he was readmitted to a pretoria hospital in serious condition. the archbishop of cape town thabo makgoba visited mandela at the hospital and prayed with machel, while zuma cancelled a trip to mozambique to visit him the following day. in september 2013, mandela was discharged from hospital, although his condition remained unstable.

after suffering from a prolonged respiratory infection, mandela died on 5 december 2013 at the age of 95, at around 20:50 local time (utc+2) at his home in houghton, surrounded by his family. zuma publicly announced his death on television, proclaiming ten days of national mourning, a memorial service held at johannesburg's fnb stadium on 10 december 2013, and 8 december as a national day of prayer and reflection. mandela's body lay in state from 11 to 13 december at the union buildings in pretoria and a state funeral was held on 15 december in qunu. approximately 90 representatives of foreign states travelled to south africa to attend memorial events. it was later revealed that 300 million rand originally earmarked for humanitarian development projects had been redirected to finance the funeral. the media was awash with tributes and reminiscences, while images of and tributes to mandela proliferated across social media. his us$4.1â million estate was left to his widow, other family members, staff, and educational institutions.

mandela was a practical politician, rather than an intellectual scholar or political theorist. according to biographer tom lodge, ""for mandela, politics has always been primarily about enacting stories, about making narratives, primarily about morally exemplary conduct, and only secondarily about ideological vision, more about means rather than ends."" mandela identified as both an african nationalist, an ideological position he held since joining the anc, and as a socialist.

the historian sabelo j. ndlovu-gatsheni described mandela as a ""liberal african nationalistâdecolonial humanist"", while political analyst raymond suttner cautioned against labelling mandela a liberal and stated that mandela displayed a ""hybrid socio-political make-up"". mandela took political ideas from other thinkersâamong them indian independence leaders like gandhi and nehru, african-american civil rights activists, and african nationalists like nkrumahâand applied them to the south african situation. at the same time he rejected other aspects of their thought, such as the anti-white sentiment of many african nationalists. in doing so he synthesised both counter-cultural and hegemonic views, for instance by drawing upon ideas from the then-dominant afrikaner nationalism in promoting his anti-apartheid vision.

his political development was strongly influenced by his legal training and practice, in particular his hope to achieve change not through violence but through ""legal revolution"". over the course of his life, he began by advocating a path of non-violence, later embracing violence, and then adopting a non-violent approach to negotiation and reconciliation. when endorsing violence, he did so because he saw no alternative, and was always pragmatic about it, perceiving it as a means to get his opponent to the negotiating table. he sought to target symbols of white supremacy and racist oppression rather than white people as individuals, and was anxious not to inaugurate a race war in south africa. this willingness to use violence distinguishes mandela from the ideology of gandhism, with which some commentators have sought to associate him.

although he presented himself in an autocratic manner in several speeches, mandela was a devout believer in democracy and abided by majority decisions even when deeply disagreeing with them. he had exhibited a commitment to the values of democracy and human rights since at least the 1960s. he held a conviction that ""inclusivity, accountability and freedom of speech"" were the fundamentals of democracy, and was driven by a belief in natural and human rights. suttner argued that there were ""two modes of leadership"" that mandela adopted. on one side he adhered to ideas about collective leadership, although on the other believed that there were scenarios in which a leader had to be decisive and act without consultation to achieve a particular objective.

according to lodge, mandela's political thought reflected tensions between his support for liberal democracy and pre-colonial african forms of consensus decision making. he was an admirer of british-style parliamentary democracy, stating that ""i regard the british parliament as the most democratic institution in the world, and the independence and impartiality of its judiciary never fail to arouse my admiration."" in this he has been described as being committed to ""the euro-north american modernist project of emancipation"", something which distinguishes him from other african nationalist and socialist leaders like nyerere who were concerned about embracing styles of democratic governance that were western, rather than african, in origin. mandela nevertheless also expressed admiration for what he deemed to be indigenous forms of democracy, describing xhosa traditional society's mode of governance as ""democracy in its purest form"". he also spoke of an influential african ethical tenet, ubuntu, which was a ngnuni term meaning ""a person is a person through other persons"" or ""i am because we are.""

mandela advocated the ultimate establishment of a classless society, with sampson describing him as being ""openly opposed to capitalism, private land-ownership and the power of big money"". mandela was influenced by marxism, and during the revolution he advocated scientific socialism. he denied being a communist at the treason trial, and maintained this stance both when later talking to journalists, and in his autobiography. according to the sociologist craig soudien, ""sympathetic as mandela was to socialism, a communist he was not."" conversely, the biographer david jones smith stated that mandela ""embraced communism and communists"" in the late 1950s and early 1960s, while the historian stephen ellis commented that mandela had assimilated much of the marxistâleninist ideology by 1960.

ellis also found evidence that mandela had been an active member of the south african communist party during the late 1950s and early 1960s, something that was confirmed after his death by both the anc and the sacp, the latter of which claimed that he was not only a member of the party, but also served on its central committee. his membership had been hidden by the anc, aware that knowledge of mandela's former sacp involvement might have been detrimental to his attempts to attract support from western countries. mandela's view of these western governments differed from those of marxistâleninists, for he did not believe that they were anti-democratic or reactionary and remained committed to democratic systems of governance.

the 1955 freedom charter, which mandela had helped create, called for the nationalisation of banks, gold mines and land, to ensure equal distribution of wealth. despite these beliefs, mandela initiated a programme of privatisation during his presidency in line with trends in other countries of the time. it has been repeatedly suggested that mandela would have preferred to develop a social democratic economy in south africa but that this was not feasible as a result of the international political and economic situation during the early 1990s. this decision was in part influenced by the fall of the socialist states in the soviet union and eastern bloc during the early 1990s.

mandela was widely considered a charismatic leader, described by biographer mary benson as ""a born mass leader who could not help magnetizing people"". he was highly image conscious and throughout his life always sought out fine quality clothes, with many commentators believing that he carried himself in a regal manner. his aristocratic heritage was repeatedly emphasised by supporters, thus contributing to his ""charismatic power"". while living in johannesburg in the 1950s, he cultivated the image of the ""african gentleman"", having ""the pressed clothes, correct manners, and modulated public speech"" associated with such a position. in doing so, lodge argued that mandela became ""one of the first media politicians ... embodying a glamour and a style that projected ""visually"" a brave new african world of modernity and freedom"". mandela was known to change his clothes several times a day, and he became so associated with highly coloured batik shirts after assuming the presidency that they came to be known as ""madiba shirts"".

for political scientists betty glad and robert blanton, mandela was an ""exceptionally intelligent, shrewd, and loyal leader"". his official biographer, anthony sampson, commented that he was a ""master of imagery and performance"", excelling at presenting himself well in press photographs and producing sound bites. his public speeches were presented in a formal, stiff manner, and often consisted of clichã©d set phrases. he typically spoke slowly, and carefully chose his words. although he was not considered a great orator, his speeches conveyed ""his personal commitment, charm and humour"".

mandela was a private person who often concealed his emotions and confided in very few people. privately, he lived an austere life, refusing to drink alcohol or smoke, and even as president made his own bed. renowned for his mischievous sense of humour, he was known for being both stubborn and loyal, and at times exhibited a quick temper. he was typically friendly and welcoming, and appeared relaxed in conversation with everyone, including his opponents. a self-described anglophile, he claimed to have lived by the ""trappings of british style and manners"". constantly polite and courteous, he was attentive to all, irrespective of their age or status, and often talked to children or servants. he was known for his ability to find common ground with very different communities. in later life, he always looked for the best in people, even defending political opponents to his allies, who sometimes thought him too trusting of others. he was fond of indian cuisine, and had a lifelong interest in archaeology and boxing.

he was raised in the methodist denomination of christianity; the methodist church of southern africa claimed that he retained his allegiance to them throughout his life. on analysing mandela's writings, the theologian dion forster described him as a christian humanist, although added that his thought relied to a greater extent on the southern african concept of ubuntu than on christian theology. according to sampson, mandela never had ""a strong religious faith"" however, while boehmer stated that mandela's religious belief was ""never robust"".

mandela was very self-conscious about being a man and regularly made references to manhood. he was heterosexual, and biographer fatima meer said that he was ""easily tempted"" by women. another biographer, martin meredith, characterised him as being ""by nature a romantic"", highlighting that he had relationships with various women. mandela was married three times, fathered six children, and had seventeen grandchildren and at least seventeen great-grandchildren. he could be stern and demanding of his children, although he was more affectionate with his grandchildren. his first marriage was to evelyn ntoko mase in october 1944; they divorced in march 1958 under the multiple strains of his adultery and constant absences, devotion to revolutionary agitation, and the fact that she was a jehovah's witness, a religion requiring political neutrality. mandela's second wife was the social worker winnie madikizela-mandela, whom he married in june 1958. they divorced in march 1996. mandela married his third wife, graã§a machel, on his 80th birthday in july 1998.

by the time of his death, within south africa mandela was widely considered both ""the father of the nation"" and ""the founding father of democracy"". outside of south africa, he was a ""global icon"", with the scholar of south african studies rita barnard describing him as ""one of the most revered figures of our time"". one biographer considered him ""a modern democratic hero"", while his popularity resulted in a cult of personality building up around him. some have portrayed mandela in messianic terms, in contrast to his own statement that ""i was not a messiah, but an ordinary man who had become a leader because of extraordinary circumstances."" he is often cited alongside mahatma gandhi and martin luther king, jr. as one of the 20th century's exemplary anti-racist and anti-colonial leaders. boehmer described him as ""a totem of the totemic values of our age: toleration and liberal democracy"" and ""a universal symbol of social justice"".

mandela's international fame had emerged during his incarceration in the 1980s, when he became the world's most famous prisoner, a symbol of the anti-apartheid cause, and an icon for millions who embraced the ideal of human equality. in 1986, mandela's biographer characterised him as ""the embodiment of the struggle for liberation"" in south africa. meredith stated that in becoming ""a potent symbol of resistance"" to apartheid during the 1980s, he had gained ""mythical status"" internationally. sampson commented that even during his life, this myth had become ""so powerful that it blurs the realities"", converting mandela into ""a secular saint"". within a decade of the end of his presidency, mandela's era was being widely thought of as ""a golden age of hope and harmony"", with much nostalgia being expressed for it. his name was often invoked by those criticising his successors like mbeki and zuma. across the world, mandela earned international acclaim for his activism in overcoming apartheid and fostering racial reconciliation, coming to be viewed as ""a moral authority"" with a great ""concern for truth"". mandela's iconic status has been blamed for concealing the complexities of his life.

mandela generated controversy throughout his career as an activist and politician, having detractors on both the right and the radical left. during the 1980s, mandela was widely labelled a terrorist by prominent political figures in the western world for his embrace of political violence. according to thatcher, for instance, the anc was ""a typical terrorist organisation"". the us government's state and defense departments officially designated the anc as a terrorist organisation, resulting in mandela remaining on their terrorism watch-list until 2008. on the left, some voices in the ancâamong them frank b. wilderson iiiâaccused him of selling out for agreeing to enter negotiations with the apartheid government and for not implementing the reforms of the freedom charter during his presidency. according to barnard, ""there is also a sense in which his chiefly bearing and mode of conduct, the very respect and authority he accrued in representing his nation in his own person, went against the spirit of democracy"", and concerns were similarly expressed that he placed his own status and celebrity above the transformation of his country. his government would be criticised for its failure to deal with both the hiv/aids pandemic and the high levels of poverty in south africa. mandela was also criticised for his friendship with political leaders such as castro, gaddafi, and suhartoâdeemed dictators by criticsâas well as his refusal to condemn their governments' human rights violations.

over the course of his life, mandela was given over 250 awards, accolades, prizes, honorary degrees and citizenships in recognition of his political achievements.
among his awards were the nobel peace prize, the us presidential medal of freedom, the soviet union's lenin peace prize, and the libyan al-gaddafi international prize for human rights. in 1990, india awarded him the bharat ratna, and in 1992 pakistan gave him their nishan-e-pakistan. the same year, he was awarded the atatã¼rk peace award by turkey; he at first refused the award, citing human rights violations committed by turkey at the time, but later accepted the award in 1999. he was appointed to the order of isabella the catholic and the order of canada, and was the first living person to be made an honorary canadian citizen. queen elizabeth ii appointed him as a bailiff grand cross of the order of st. john and granted him membership in the order of merit.

in 2004, johannesburg granted mandela the freedom of the city, and in 2008 a mandela statue was unveiled at the spot where mandela was released from prison. on the day of reconciliation 2013, a bronze statue of mandela was unveiled at pretoria's union buildings.
in november 2009, the united nations general assembly proclaimed mandela's birthday, 18 july, as ""mandela day"", marking his contribution to the anti-apartheid struggle. it called on individuals to donate 67 minutes to doing something for others, commemorating the 67 years that mandela had been a part of the movement. in 2015 the un general assembly named the amended standard minimum rules for the treatment of prisoners as ""the mandela rules"" to honour his legacy.

the first biography of mandela was authored by mary benson, based on brief interviews with him that she had conducted in the 1960s. two authorised biographies were later produced by friends of mandela. the first was fatima meer's ""higher than hope"", which was heavily influenced by winnie and thus placed great emphasis on mandela's family. the second was anthony sampson's ""mandela"", published in 1999. other biographies included martin meredith's ""mandela"", first published in 1997, and tom lodge's ""mandela"", brought out in 2006.

since the late 1980s, mandela's image began to appear on a proliferation of items, among them ""photographs, paintings, drawings, statues, public murals, buttons, t-shirts, refrigerator magnets, and more"", items that have been characterised as ""mandela kitsch"". in the 1980s he was the subject of several songs, such as the specials' ""free nelson mandela"", hugh masekela's ""bring him back home (nelson mandela)"", and johnny clegg's ""asimbonanga (mandela)"", which helped to bring awareness of his imprisonment to an international audience.

following his death, many internet memes appeared featuring images of mandela with his inspirational quotes superimposed onto them. mandela has also been depicted in films on multiple occasions. some of these, such as the 2013 feature film """" and the 1996 documentary ""mandela"", have focused on covering his long life, whereas others, such as the 2009 feature film ""invictus"" and the 2010 documentary ""the 16th man"", have focused on specific events in his life. it has been argued that in ""invictus"" and other films, ""the america film industry"" has played a significant part in ""the crafting of mandela's global image"".

mark zuckerberg,"
mark elliot zuckerberg (; born may 14, 1984) is an american technology entrepreneur and philanthropist. zuckerberg is known for co-founding and leading facebook as its chairman and chief executive officer. he also co-founded and is a board member of the solar sail spacecraft development project breakthrough starshot.

born in white plains, new york, zuckerberg attended harvard university, where he launched facebook from his dormitory room on february 4, 2004, with college roommates eduardo saverin, andrew mccollum, dustin moskovitz, and chris hughes. originally launched to select college campuses, the site expanded rapidly and eventually beyond colleges, reaching one billion users by 2012. zuckerberg took the company public in may 2012 with majority shares. his net worth is estimated to be $55.0 billion as of november 30, 2018, declining over the last year with facebook stock as a whole. in 2007 at age 23 he became the world's youngest self-made billionaire. as of 2018, he is the only person under 50 in the ""forbes"" ten richest people list, and the only one under 40 in the top 20 billionaires list.

since 2010, ""time"" magazine has named zuckerberg among the 100 wealthiest and most influential people in the world as a part of its person of the year award. in december 2016, zuckerberg was ranked 10th on ""forbes"" list of the world's most powerful people.

zuckerberg was born on may 14, 1984, in white plains, new york. his parents are karen (nã©e kempner), a psychiatrist, and edward zuckerberg, a dentist. he and his three sisters, randi, donna and arielle, were brought up in dobbs ferry, new york, a small westchester county village about 21 miles north of midtown manhattan. zuckerberg was raised in a reform jewish household, and his ancestors hailed from germany, austria and poland. he had a ""star wars"" themed bar mitzvah when he turned 13 and once ""questioned things"" before deciding ""religion is very important"".

at ardsley high school, zuckerberg excelled in classes. after two years, he transferred to the private school phillips exeter academy, in new hampshire, where he won prizes in mathematics, astronomy, physics, and classical studies. in his youth, he also attended the johns hopkins center for talented youth summer camp. on his college application, zuckerberg stated that he could read and write french, hebrew, latin, and ancient greek. he was captain of the fencing team.

zuckerberg began using computers and writing software in middle school. his father taught him atari basic programming in the 1990s, and later hired software developer david newman to tutor him privately. zuckerberg took a graduate course in the subject at mercy college near his home while still in high school. in one program, since his father's dental practice was operated from their home, he built a software program he called ""zucknet"" that allowed all the computers between the house and dental office to communicate with each other. it is considered a ""primitive"" version of aol's instant messenger, which came out the following year.

according to writer jose antonio vargas, ""some kids played computer games. mark created them."" zuckerberg himself recalls this period: ""i had a bunch of friends who were artists. they'd come over, draw stuff, and i'd build a game out of it."" vargas notes that zuckerberg was not, however, a typical ""geek-klutz"", as he later became captain of his prep school fencing team and earned a classics diploma. napster co-founder sean parker, a close friend, notes that zuckerberg was ""really into greek odysseys and all that stuff"", recalling how he once quoted lines from the roman epic poem ""aeneid"", by virgil, during a facebook product conference.

during zuckerberg's high school years, he worked under the company name intelligent media group to build a music player called the synapse media player. the device used machine learning to learn the user's listening habits, which was posted to ""slashdot"" and received a rating of 3 out of 5 from ""pc magazine"".

vargas noted that by the time zuckerberg began classes at harvard, he had already achieved a ""reputation as a programming prodigy"". he studied psychology and computer science and belonged to alpha epsilon pi and kirkland house. in his sophomore year, he wrote a program that he called coursematch, which allowed users to make class selection decisions based on the choices of other students and also to help them form study groups. a short time later, he created a different program he initially called facemash that let students select the best-looking person from a choice of photos. according to arie hasit, zuckerberg's roommate at the time, ""he built the site for fun"". hasit explains:

we had books called face books, which included the names and pictures of everyone who lived in the student dorms. at first, he built a site and placed two pictures or pictures of two males and two females. visitors to the site had to choose who was ""hotter"" and according to the votes there would be a ranking.

the site went up over a weekend, but by monday morning, the college shut it down, because its popularity had overwhelmed one of harvard's network switches and prevented students from accessing the internet. in addition, many students complained that their photos were being used without permission. zuckerberg apologized publicly, and the student paper ran articles stating that his site was ""completely improper.""

the following semester, in january 2004, zuckerberg began writing code for a new website. on february 4, 2004, zuckerberg launched ""thefacebook"", originally located at thefacebook.com.

six days after the site launched, three harvard seniors, cameron winklevoss, tyler winklevoss, and divya narendra, accused zuckerberg of intentionally misleading them into believing he would help them build a social network called harvardconnection.com, while he was instead using their ideas to build a competing product. the three complained to ""the harvard crimson"", and the newspaper began an investigation in response.

following the official launch of the facebook social media platform, the three filed a lawsuit against zuckerberg that resulted in a settlement. the agreed settlement was for 1.2 million facebook shares.

zuckerberg dropped out of harvard in his sophomore year in order to complete his project. in january 2014, he recalled:

i remember really vividly, you know, having pizza with my friends a day or two afterâi opened up the first version of facebook at the time i thought, ""you know, someone needs to build a service like this for the world."" but i just never thought that we'd be the ones to help do it. and i think a lot of what it comes down to is we just cared more.

on may 28, 2017, zuckerberg received an honorary degree from harvard.

on february 4, 2004, zuckerberg launched facebook from his harvard dormitory room. an earlier inspiration for facebook may have come from phillips exeter academy, the prep school from which zuckerberg graduated in 2002. it published its own student directory, ""the photo address book"", which students referred to as ""the facebook"". such photo directories were an important part of the student social experience at many private schools. with them, students were able to list attributes such as their class years, their friends, and their telephone numbers.

once at college, zuckerberg's facebook started off as just a ""harvard thing"" until zuckerberg decided to spread it to other schools, enlisting the help of roommate dustin moskovitz. they began with columbia university, new york university, stanford, dartmouth, cornell, university of pennsylvania, brown, and yale. samyr laine, a triple jumper representing haiti at the 2012 summer olympics, shared a room with zuckerberg during facebook's founding. ""mark was clearly on to great things,"" said laine, who was facebook's fourteenth user.

zuckerberg, moskovitz and some friends moved to palo alto, california in silicon valley where they leased a small house that served as an office. over the summer, zuckerberg met peter thiel, who invested in the company. they got their first office in mid-2004. according to zuckerberg, the group planned to return to harvard, but eventually decided to remain in california. they had already turned down offers by major corporations to buy the company. in an interview in 2007, zuckerberg explained his reasoning: ""it's not because of the amount of money. for me and my colleagues, the most important thing is that we create an open information flow for people. having media corporations owned by conglomerates is just not an attractive idea to me.""

he restated these goals to ""wired"" magazine in 2010: ""the thing i really care about is the mission, making the world open."" earlier, in april 2009, zuckerberg sought the advice of former netscape cfo peter currie about financing strategies for facebook. on july 21, 2010, zuckerberg reported that the company reached the 500 million-user mark. when asked whether facebook could earn more income from advertising as a result of its phenomenal growth, he explained:

i guess we couldâ ... if you look at how much of our page is taken up with ads compared to the average search query. the average for us is a little less than 10 percent of the pages and the average for search is about 20 percent taken up with adsâ ... that's the simplest thing we could do. but we aren't like that. we make enough money. right, i mean, we are keeping things running; we are growing at the rate we want to.

in 2010, steven levy, who wrote the 1984 book """", wrote that zuckerberg ""clearly thinks of himself as a hacker"". zuckerberg said that ""it's ok to break things"" ""to make them better"". facebook instituted ""hackathons"" held every six to eight weeks where participants would have one night to conceive of and complete a project. the company provided music, food, and beer at the hackathons, and many facebook staff members, including zuckerberg, regularly attended. ""the idea is that you can build something really good in a night"", zuckerberg told levy. ""and that's part of the personality of facebook nowâ ... it's definitely very core to my personality.""

""vanity fair"" magazine named zuckerberg number 1 on its 2010 list of the top 100 ""most influential people of the information age"". zuckerberg ranked number 23 on the ""vanity fair"" 100 list in 2009. in 2010, zuckerberg was chosen as number 16 in ""new statesman""s annual survey of the world's 50 most influential figures.

in a 2011 interview with pbs shortly after the death of steve jobs, zuckerberg said that jobs had advised him on how to create a management team at facebook that was ""focused on building as high quality and good things as you are"".
on october 1, 2012, zuckerberg visited russian prime minister dmitry medvedev in moscow to stimulate social media innovation in russia and to boost facebook's position in the russian market. russia's communications minister tweeted that prime minister dmitry medvedev urged the social media giant's founder to abandon plans to lure away russian programmers and instead consider opening a research center in moscow. in 2012, facebook had roughly 9 million users in russia, while domestic clone vk had around 34 million. rebecca van dyck, facebook's head of consumer marketing, claimed that 85 million american facebook users were exposed to the first day of the home promotional campaign on april 6, 2013.

on august 19, 2013, ""the washington post"" reported that zuckerberg's facebook profile was hacked by an unemployed web developer.

at the 2013 techcrunch disrupt conference, held in september, zuckerberg stated that he is working towards registering the 5 billion humans who were not connected to the internet as of the conference on facebook. zuckerberg then explained that this is intertwined with the aim of the internet.org project, whereby facebook, with the support of other technology companies, seeks to increase the number of people connected to the internet.

zuckerberg was the keynote speaker at the 2014 mobile world congress (mwc), held in barcelona, spain, in march 2014, which was attended by 75,000 delegates. various media sources highlighted the connection between facebook's focus on mobile technology and zuckerberg's speech, claiming that mobile represents the future of the company. zuckerberg's speech expands upon the goal that he raised at the techcrunch conference in september 2013, whereby he is working towards expanding internet coverage into developing countries.

alongside other american technology figures like jeff bezos and tim cook, zuckerberg hosted visiting chinese politician lu wei, known as the ""internet czar"" for his influence in the enforcement of china's online policy, at facebook's headquarters on december 8, 2014. the meeting occurred after zuckerberg participated in a q&a session at tsinghua university in beijing, china, on october 23, 2014, where he attempted to converse in mandarin chinese; although facebook is banned in china, zuckerberg is highly regarded among the people and was at the university to help fuel the nation's burgeoning entrepreneur sector.

zuckerberg fielded questions during a live q&a session at the company's headquarters in menlo park on december 11, 2014. the founder and ceo explained that he does not believe facebook is a waste of time, because it facilitates social engagement, and participating in a public session was so that he could ""learn how to better serve the community"".

zuckerberg receives a one-dollar salary as ceo of facebook. in june 2016, ""business insider"" named zuckerberg one of the ""top 10 business visionaries creating value for the world"" along with elon musk and sal khan, due to the fact that he and his wife ""pledged to give away 99% of their wealth â which is estimated at $55.0 billion.""

a month after zuckerberg launched facebook in february 2004, i2hub, another campus-only service, created by wayne chang, was launched. i2hub focused on peer-to-peer file sharing. at the time, both i2hub and facebook were gaining the attention of the press and growing rapidly in users and publicity. in august 2004, zuckerberg, andrew mccollum, adam d'angelo, and sean parker launched a competing peer-to-peer file sharing service called wirehog, a precursor to facebook platform applications.

on may 24, 2007, zuckerberg announced facebook platform, a development platform for programmers to create social applications within facebook. within weeks, many applications had been built and some already had millions of users. it grew to more than 800,000 developers around the world building applications for facebook platform.

on november 6, 2007, zuckerberg announced beacon, a social advertising system that enabled people to share information with their facebook friends based on their browsing activities on other sites. for example, ebay sellers could let friends know automatically what they have for sale via the facebook news feed as they listed items for sale. the program came under scrutiny because of privacy concerns from groups and individual users. zuckerberg and facebook failed to respond to the concerns quickly, and on december 5, 2007, zuckerberg wrote a blog post on facebook, taking responsibility for the concerns about beacon and offering an easier way for users to opt out of the service.

in 2007, zuckerberg was added to mit technology review's tr35 list as one of the top 35 innovators in the world under the age of 35. on july 23, 2008, zuckerberg announced facebook connect, a version of facebook platform for users.

in a public facebook post, zuckerberg launched the internet.org project in late august 2013. he explained that the primary aim of the initiative is to provide internet access to the five billion people who are not connected as of the launch date. using a three-tier strategy, internet.org will also create new jobs and open up new markets, according to zuckerberg. he stated in his post:

the world economy is going through a massive transition right now. the knowledge economy is the future. by bringing everyone online, we'll not only improve billions of lives, but we'll also improve our own as we benefit from the ideas and productivity they contribute to the world. giving everyone the opportunity to connect is the foundation for enabling the knowledge economy. it is not the only thing we need to do, but it's a fundamental and necessary step.

to stay proven on the efforts of bringing in the concept of net neutrality, zuckerberg met narendra modi, satya nadella and sundar pichai at silicon valley, to discuss on how to effectively establish affordable internet access to the less developed countries. as a token of initiation, he changed his facebook profile picture to extend his support to the digital india to help the rural communities to stay connected to the internet.

harvard students cameron winklevoss, tyler winklevoss, and divya narendra accused zuckerberg of intentionally making them believe he would help them build a social network called harvardconnection.com (later called connectu). they filed a lawsuit in 2004, but it was dismissed on a technicality on march 28, 2007. it was refiled soon thereafter in federal court in boston. facebook countersued in regards to social butterfly, a project put out by the winklevoss chang group, an alleged partnership between connectu and i2hub. on june 25, 2008, the case settled and facebook agreed to transfer over 1.2 million common shares and pay $20 million in cash.

in november 2007, confidential court documents were posted on the website of ""02138"", a magazine that catered to harvard alumni. they included zuckerberg's social security number, his parents' home address, and his girlfriend's address. facebook filed to have the documents removed, but the judge ruled in favor of ""02138"".

a lawsuit filed by eduardo saverin against facebook and zuckerberg was settled out of court. though terms of the settlement were sealed, the company affirmed saverin's title as co-founder of facebook. saverin signed a non-disclosure contract after the settlement.

in june 2010, pakistani deputy attorney general muhammad azhar sidiqque launched a criminal investigation into zuckerberg and facebook co-founders dustin moskovitz and chris hughes after a ""draw muhammad"" contest was hosted on facebook. the investigation named the anonymous german woman who created the contest. sidiqque asked the country's police to contact interpol to have zuckerberg and the three others arrested for blasphemy. on may 19, 2010, facebook's website was temporarily blocked in pakistan until facebook removed the contest from its website at the end of may. sidiqque also asked its un representative to raise the issue with the united nations general assembly.

in june 2010, paul ceglia, the owner of a wood pellet fuel company in allegany county, upstate new york, filed suit against zuckerberg, claiming 84 percent ownership of facebook and seeking monetary damages. according to ceglia, he and zuckerberg signed a contract on april 28, 2003, that an initial fee of $1,000 entitled ceglia to 50% of the website's revenue, as well as an additional 1% interest in the business per day after january 1, 2004, until website completion. zuckerberg was developing other projects at the time, among which was ""facemash"", the predecessor of facebook, but did not register the domain name ""thefacebook.com"" until january 1, 2004. facebook management dismissed the lawsuit as ""completely frivolous"". facebook spokesman barry schnitt told a reporter that ceglia's counsel had unsuccessfully sought an out-of-court settlement.

on october 26, 2012, federal authorities arrested ceglia, charging him with mail and wire fraud and of ""tampering with, destroying and fabricating evidence in a scheme to defraud the facebook founder of billions of dollars."" ceglia is accused of fabricating emails to make it appear that he and zuckerberg discussed details about an early version of facebook, although after examining their emails, investigators found there was no mention of facebook in them. some law firms withdrew from the case before it was initiated and others after ceglia's arrest.

on july 2, 2016, israeli cabinet minister gilad erdan accused zuckerberg of having some responsibility for deadly attacks by palestinians against israelis. according to him, the social network was not doing enough to ban posts to its platform that incite violence against israelis. ""some of the victims' blood is on zuckerberg's hands"", erdan said.

in january 2017, zuckerberg filed eight ""quiet title and partition"" lawsuits against hundreds of native hawaiians to purchase small tracts of land which they own. this land is contained within the 700 acres of land in the hawaiian island of kauai that zuckerberg had purchased in 2014. when he learned that hawaiian land ownership law differs from that of the other 49 states, he dropped the lawsuits.

on april 10 and april 11, 2018, zuckerberg began testifying before the united states senate committee on commerce, science, and transportation regarding the usage of personal data by facebook in relation to the facebookâcambridge analytica data breach. he has called the whole affair a breach of trust between aleksandr kogan, cambridge analytica, and facebook. zuckerberg has refused requests to appear to give evidence on the matter to a parliamentary committee in the united kingdom.

a movie based on zuckerberg and the founding years of facebook, ""the social network"" was released on october 1, 2010, starring jesse eisenberg as zuckerberg. after zuckerberg was told about the film, he responded, ""i just wished that nobody made a movie of me while i was still alive."" also, after the film's script was leaked on the internet and it was apparent that the film would not portray zuckerberg in a wholly positive light, he stated that he wanted to establish himself as a ""good guy"". the film is based on the book ""the accidental billionaires"" by ben mezrich, which the book's publicist once described as ""big juicy fun"" rather than ""reportage"". the film's screenwriter aaron sorkin told ""new york"" magazine, ""i don't want my fidelity to be the truth; i want it to be storytelling"", adding, ""what is the big deal about accuracy purely for accuracy's sake, and can we not have the true be the enemy of the good?""

upon winning the golden globe award for best picture on january 16, 2011, producer scott rudin thanked facebook and zuckerberg ""for his willingness to allow us to use his life and work as a metaphor through which to tell a story about communication and the way we relate to each other."" sorkin, who won for best screenplay, retracted some of the impressions given in his script:

on january 29, 2011, zuckerberg made a surprise guest appearance on ""saturday night live"", which was being hosted by jesse eisenberg. they both said it was the first time they ever met. eisenberg asked zuckerberg, who had been critical of his portrayal by the film, what he thought of the movie. zuckerberg replied, ""it was interesting."" in a subsequent interview about their meeting, eisenberg explains that he was ""nervous to meet him, because i had spent now, a year and a half thinking about himâ ..."" he adds, ""mark has been so gracious about something that's really so uncomfortableâ ... the fact that he would do ""snl"" and make fun of the situation is so sweet and so generous. it's the best possible way to handle something that, i think, could otherwise be very uncomfortable.""

jeff jarvis, author of the book ""public parts"", interviewed zuckerberg and believes sorkin made up too much of the story. he states, ""that's what the internet is accused of doing, making stuff up, not caring about the facts.""

according to david kirkpatrick, former technology editor at ""fortune"" magazine and author of ""the facebook effect: the inside story of the company that is connecting the world,"" (2011), ""the film is only ""40% trueâ ... he is not snide and sarcastic in a cruel way, the way zuckerberg is played in the movie."" he says that ""a lot of the factual incidents are accurate, but many are distorted and the overall impression is false"", and concludes that primarily ""his motivations were to try and come up with a new way to share information on the internet"".

although the film portrays zuckerberg's creation of facebook in order to elevate his stature after not getting into any of the elite final clubs at harvard, zuckerberg said he had no interest in joining the clubs. kirkpatrick agrees that the impression implied by the film is ""false"". karel baloun, a former senior engineer at facebook, notes that the ""image of zuckerberg as a socially inept nerd is overstatedâ ... it is fictionâ ..."" he likewise dismisses the film's assertion that he ""would deliberately betray a friend"".

zuckerberg voiced himself on an episode of ""the simpsons"" titled ""loan-a lisa"", which first aired on october 3, 2010. in the episode, lisa simpson and her friend nelson encounter zuckerberg at an entrepreneurs' convention. zuckerberg tells lisa that she does not need to graduate from college to be wildly successful, referencing bill gates and richard branson as examples.

on october 9, 2010, ""saturday night live"" lampooned zuckerberg and facebook. andy samberg played zuckerberg. the real zuckerberg was reported to have been amused: ""i thought this was funny.""

stephen colbert awarded a ""medal of fear"" to zuckerberg at the rally to restore sanity and/or fear on october 30, 2010, ""because he values his privacy much more than he values yours"".

zuckerberg appears in the climax of the documentary film ""terms and conditions may apply"".

zuckerberg was parodied in the ""south park"" episode ""franchise prequel"".

on december 7, 2018, epic rap battles of history released a rap battle between zuckerberg and elon musk.

zuckerberg donated an undisclosed amount to diaspora, an open-source personal web server that implements a distributed social networking service. he called it a ""cool idea"".

zuckerberg founded the start-up: education foundation. on september 22, 2010, it was reported that zuckerberg had donated $100 million to newark public schools, the public school system of newark, new jersey. critics noted the timing of the donation as being close to the release of ""the social network"", which painted a somewhat negative portrait of zuckerberg. zuckerberg responded to the criticism, saying, ""the thing that i was most sensitive about with the movie timing was, i didn't want the press about ""the social network"" movie to get conflated with the newark project. i was thinking about doing this anonymously just so that the two things could be kept separate."" newark mayor cory booker stated that he and new jersey governor chris christie had to convince zuckerberg's team not to make the donation anonymously. the money was largely wasted, according to journalist dale russakoff.

on december 9, 2010, zuckerberg, bill gates, and investor warren buffett signed ""the giving pledge"", in which they promised to donate to charity at least half of their wealth over the course of time, and invited others among the wealthy to donate 50 percent or more of their wealth to charity.

in december 2012, zuckerberg and his wife priscilla chan announced that over the course of their lives they would give the majority of their wealth to ""advancing human potential and promoting equality"" in the spirit of the giving pledge.

on december 1, 2015, they announced they would eventually give 99 percent of their facebook shares (worth about us$45 billion at the time) to the chan zuckerberg initiative.

on december 19, 2013, zuckerberg announced a donation of 18 million facebook shares to the silicon valley community foundation, to be executed by the end of the monthâbased on facebook's valuation as of then, the shares totaled $990 million in value. on december 31, 2013, the donation was recognized as the largest charitable gift on public record for 2013. ""the chronicle of philanthropy"" placed zuckerberg and his wife at the top of the magazine's annual list of 50 most generous americans for 2013, having donated roughly $1 billion to charity.

in october 2014, zuckerberg and his wife priscilla chan donated us$25 million to combat the ebola virus disease, specifically the west african ebola virus epidemic. in 2016, the chan zuckerberg initiative announced that it would give $600 million to biohub a location in san francisco's mission bay district near the university of california, san francisco, to allow for easy interaction and collaboration between scientists at ucsf; university of california, berkeley; and stanford university.

on december 1, 2015, zuckerberg and chan announced the birth of their first daughter max, and in an open letter to max, they pledged to donate 99% of their facebook shares, then valued at us$45 billion, to the chan zuckerberg initiative, their new organization that will focus on health and education. the donation will not be given immediately, but over the course of their lives. instead of forming a charitable corporation to donate the value of the stock to, as bill gates, warren buffett, larry page, sergey brin and other tech billionaires have done, zuckerberg and chan chose to use the structure of a limited liability company. this has drawn criticism from a number of journalists.

on august 28, 2017, chan and zuckerberg announced the birth of their second daughter.

in 2002, zuckerberg registered to vote in westchester county, new york, where he grew up, but did not cast a ballot until november 2008. santa clara county registrar of voters spokeswoman, elma rosas, told bloomberg that zuckerberg is listed as ""no preference"" on voter rolls, and he voted in at least two of the past three general elections, in 2008 and 2012.

zuckerberg has never revealed his own political views: some news outlets consider him to be a conservative, while others consider him liberal.

on february 13, 2013, zuckerberg hosted his first ever fundraising event for new jersey governor chris christie. zuckerberg's particular interest on this occasion was education reform, and christie's education reform work focused on teachers unions and the expansion of charter schools. later that year, zuckerberg hosted a campaign fundraiser for newark mayor cory booker, who was running in the 2013 new jersey special senate election. in september 2010, with the support of governor chris christie, booker obtained a us$100 million pledge from zuckerberg to newark public schools. in december 2012, zuckerberg donated 18 million shares to the silicon valley community foundation, a community organization that includes education in its list of grant-making areas.
on april 11, 2013, zuckerberg led the launch of a 501(c)(4) lobbying group called fwd.us. the founders and contributors to the group were primarily silicon valley entrepreneurs and investors, and its president was joe green, a close friend of zuckerberg. the goals of the group include immigration reform, improving the state of education in the united states, and enabling more technological breakthroughs that benefit the public, yet it has also been criticized for financing ads advocating a variety of oil and gas development initiatives, including drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge and the keystone xl pipeline. in 2013, numerous liberal and progressive groups, such as the league of conservation voters, moveon.org, the sierra club, democracy for america, credo, daily kos, 350.org, and presente and progressives united agreed to either pull their facebook ad buys or not buy facebook ads for at least two weeks, in protest of zuckerberg ads funded by fwd.us that were in support of oil drilling and the keystone xl pipeline, and in opposition to obamacare among republican united states senators who back immigration reform.

a media report on june 20, 2013 revealed that zuckerberg actively engaged with facebook users on his own profile page after the online publication of a fwd.us video. in response to a claim that the fwd.us organization is ""just about tech wanting to hire more people"", the internet entrepreneur replied: ""the bigger problem we're trying to address is ensuring the 11 million undocumented folks living in this country now and similar folks in the future are treated fairly.""

in june 2013, zuckerberg joined facebook employees in a company float as part of the annual san francisco lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender pride celebration. the company first participated in the event in 2011, with 70 employees, and this number increased to 700 for the 2013 march. the 2013 pride celebration was especially significant, as it followed a u.s. supreme court ruling that deemed the defense of marriage act (doma) unconstitutional.
when questioned about the mid-2013 prism scandal at the techcrunch disrupt conference in september 2013, zuckerberg stated that the u.s. government ""blew it."" he further explained that the government performed poorly in regard to the protection of the freedoms of its citizens, the economy, and companies.

zuckerberg placed a statement on his facebook wall on december 9, 2015 which said that he wants ""to add my voice in support of muslims in our community and around the world"" in response to the aftermath of the november 2015 paris attacks and the 2015 san bernardino attack. the statement also said that muslims are ""always welcome"" on facebook, and that his position was a result of the fact that ""as a jew, my parents taught me that we must stand up against attacks on all communities.""

on february 24, 2016, zuckerberg sent out a company-wide internal memo to employees formally rebuking employees who had crossed out handwritten ""black lives matter"" phrases on the company walls and had written ""all lives matter"" in their place. facebook allows employees to free-write thoughts and phrases on company walls. the memo was then leaked by several employees. as zuckerberg had previously condemned this practice at previous company meetings, and other similar requests had been issued by other leaders at facebook, zuckerberg wrote in the memo that he would now consider this overwriting practice not only disrespectful, but ""malicious as well."" according to zuckerberg's memo, """"black lives matter"" doesn't mean other lives don't -- it's simply asking that the black community also achieves the justice they deserve."" the memo also noted that the act of crossing something out in itself, ""means silencing speech, or that one person's speech is more important than another's."" zuckerberg also said in the memo that he would be launching investigations into the incidents. new york's ""daily news"" interviewed facebook employees who commented anonymously that, ""zuckerberg was genuinely angry about the incident and it really encouraged staff that zuckerberg showed a clear understanding of why the phrase 'black lives matter' must exist, as well as why writing through it is a form of harassment and erasure.""

in january 2017, zuckerberg criticized donald trump's executive order to severely limit immigrants and refugees from some countries.

cambridge analytica whistleblower christopher wylie criticized zuckerberg over facebook's role in spreading religious intolerance in sri lanka. moulavi zahran hashim, a radical islamist imam believed to be the mastermind behind the 2019 sri lanka easter bombings, preached on a pro-isil facebook account, known as ""al-ghuraba"" media.

zuckerberg met his future wife, fellow student priscilla chan, at a fraternity party during his sophomore year at harvard. they began dating in 2003.

in september 2010, zuckerberg invited chan, by then a medical student at the university of california, to move into his rented palo alto house. zuckerberg studied mandarin in preparation for the couple's visit to china in december 2010. on may 19, 2012, zuckerberg and chan married in zuckerberg's backyard in an event that also celebrated her graduation from medical school. on july 31, 2015, zuckerberg announced that he and chan were expecting a baby girl. he said he felt confident that the risk of miscarrying was low so far into the pregnancy, after chan had already suffered three miscarriages. on december 1, zuckerberg announced the birth of their daughter, maxima chan zuckerberg (""max""). the couple announced on their chinese new year video, published on february 6, 2016, that maxima's official chinese name is chen mingyu (). they welcomed their second daughter, august, in august 2017. before having children, the zuckerbergs got a puli dog named beast who has over 2 million followers on facebook.

zuckerberg has also been very active in china, and he has been a member of tsinghua university business school's advisory board since 2014.

after being raised jewish, zuckerberg identified as an atheist. he later showed an appreciation of religion, including judaism, christianity, and buddhism.

virat kohli was born on 5 november 1988 in delhi into a punjabi family. his father, prem kohli, worked as a criminal lawyer and his mother, saroj kohli, is a housewife. he has an older brother, vikas, and an older sister, bhavna. according to his family, when he was three-years old, kohli would pick up a cricket bat, start swinging it and ask his father to bowl at him.

kohli was raised in uttam nagar and started his schooling at vishal bharti public school. in 1998, the west delhi cricket academy was created, and kohli, a nine-year-old, was part of its first intake. kohli's father took him to the academy after their neighbours suggested that ""virat shouldn't waste his time in gully cricket and instead join a professional club"". kohli trained at the academy under rajkumar sharma and also played matches at the sumeet dogra academy at vasundhara enclave at the same time. sharma recounts kohli's early days at his academy, ""he oozed talent. it was so difficult to keep him quiet. he was a natural in whatever he did and i was most impressed with his attitude. he was ready to bat at any spot, and i had to literally push him home after the training sessions. he just wouldnât leave."" in ninth grade, he shifted to saviour convent in paschim vihar to help his cricket practice. apart from sports, kohli was good at academics as well, and his teachers remember him as ""a bright and alert child"". kohli's family lived in meera bagh until 2015 when they moved to gurgaon.

kohli's father died on 18 december 2006 due to a stroke after being bed-ridden for a month. regarding his early life, kohli has said in an interview, ""i've seen a lot in life. losing my father at a young age, the family business not doing too well, staying in a rented place. there were tough times for the family... it's all embedded in my memory."" according to kohli, his father supported his cricket training during his childhood, ""my father was my biggest support. he was the one who drove me to practice every day. i miss his presence sometimes.""

kohli first played for delhi under-15 team in october 2002 in the 2002â03 polly umrigar trophy. he was the leading run-getter for his team in that tournament with 172 runs at an average of 34.40. he became the captain of the team for the 2003â04 polly umrigar trophy and scored 390 runs in 5 innings at an average of 78 including two centuries and two fifties. in late 2004, he was selected in the delhi under-17 team for the 2003â04 vijay merchant trophy. he scored 470 runs in four matches at an average of 117.50 with two hundreds and top-score of 251*. delhi under-17s won the 2004â05 vijay merchant trophy in which kohli finished as the highest run-scorer with 757 runs from 7 matches at an average of 84.11 with two centuries. in february 2006, he made his list a debut for delhi against services but did not get to bat.

in april 2007, he made his twenty20 debut and finished as the highest run-getter for his team in the inter-state t20 championship with 179 runs at an average of 35.80. in julyâaugust 2007, the india under-19 team toured sri lanka. in the triangular series against sri lanka under-19s and bangladesh under-19s, kohli was the second highest run-getter with 146 runs from 5 matches. in the two-match test series that followed, he scored 244 runs at an average of 122 including a hundred and a fifty.

""espncricinfo"" commended him for making several tactical bowling changes during the tournament.

following the under-19 world cup, kohli was bought by the indian premier league franchise royal challengers bangalore for $30,000 on a youth contract. in june 2008, kohli and his under-19 teammates pradeep sangwan and tanmay srivastava were awarded the border-gavaskar scholarship. the scholarship allowed the three players to train for six weeks at cricket australia's centre of excellence in brisbane. in july 2008, he was included in india's 30-man probable squad for the icc champions trophy which was to be held in pakistan in september 2008. he was also picked in the india emerging players squad for the four-team emerging players tournament in australia. he was in fine form in that tournament and scored 206 runs in six matches at an average of 41.20.

in august 2008, kohli was included in the indian odi squad for tour of sri lanka and the champions trophy in pakistan. prior to the sri lankan tour, kohli had played only eight list a matches, and his selection was called a ""surprise call-up"". during the sri lankan tour, as both first-choice openers sachin tendulkar and virender sehwag were injured, kohli batted as a makeshift opener throughout the series. he made his international debut, at the age of 19, in the first odi of the tour and was dismissed for 12. he made his first odi half century, a score of 54, in the fourth match which helped india win the series. he had scores of 37, 25 and 31 in the other three matches. india won the series 3â2 which was india's first odi series win against sri lanka in sri lanka.

after the champions trophy was postponed to 2009, kohli was picked as a replacement for the injured shikhar dhawan in the india a squad for the unofficial tests against australia a in september 2008. he batted only once in the two-match series, and scored 49 in that innings. later that month in september 2008, he played for delhi in the nissar trophy against sngpl (winners of quaid-i-azam trophy from pakistan) and top-scored for delhi in both innings, with 52 and 197. the match was drawn but sngpl won the trophy on first-innings lead. in october 2008, kohli played for indian board president's xi in a four-day tour match against australia. he made 105 and 16* in that match against a bowling line-up consisting of brett lee, stuart clark, mitchell johnson, peter siddle and jason krejza.

kohli was included in the squad for the home odi series against england in november 2008 but was not given a chance to play, due to the inclusion of tendulkar and sehwag in the team. in december 2008, kohli was given a grade d contract in the annual bcci contracts list which entitled him to receive rs 15 lakh. he was then dropped from the squad for the five-match odi series in sri lanka against sri lanka in january 2009.

kohli was selected in the four-team emerging players tournament in julyâaugust 2009 held in australia. he opened the innings for india emerging players in that tournament and finished as the leading run-getter with 398 runs from seven matches at an average of 66.33. he scored 104 off 102 balls in the final against south africa emerging players at brisbane to help his team win the match by 17 runs and clinch the title. at the conclusion of the tournament, kris srikkanth, the chairman of the national selection committee, was impressed with kohli and remarked ""i must say, opener virat kohli was outstanding. some of the shots he played spoke about his ability."" kohli has called this tournament as the ""turning point"" of his career.

kohli returned to the national team replacing the injured gautam gambhir in the indian squad for the tri-series in sri lanka. he batted at number 4 for india in the 2009 icc champions trophy because of an injury to yuvraj singh. in the inconsequential group match against the west indies, kohli scored an unbeaten 79 in india's successful chase of 130 and won his first man of the match award. kohli played as a reserve batsman in the seven-match home odi series against australia, appearing in two matches as injury replacement. he found a place in the home odi series against sri lanka in december 2009 and scored 27 and 54 in the first two odis before making way for yuvraj who regained fitness for the third odi. however, yuvraj's finger injury recurred leading to him being ruled out indefinitely. kohli returned to the team in the fourth odi at kolkata and scored his first odi centuryâ107 off 111 ballsâsharing a 224-run partnership for the third wicket with gambhir, who made his personal best score of 150. india won by seven wickets to seal the series 3â1. the man of the match was awarded to gambhir who gave the award to kohli.

tendulkar was rested for the tri-nation odi tournament in bangladesh in january 2010, which enabled kohli to play in each of india's five matches. against bangladesh, he scored 91 to help secure a win after india collapsed to 51/3 early in their run-chase of 297. in the next match against sri lanka, kohli ended unbeaten on 71 to help india win the match with a bonus point having chased down their target of 214 within 33 overs. the next day, he scored his second odi century, against bangladesh, bringing up the mark with the winning runs. he became only the third indian batsman to score two odi centuries before their 22nd birthday, after tendulkar and suresh raina. kohli was much praised for his performances during the series in particular by the indian captain dhoni. although kohli made only two runs in the final against sri lanka in a four-wicket indian defeat, he finished as the leading run-getter of the series with 275 runs from five innings at an average of 91.66. in the three-match odi series at home against south africa in february, kohli batted in two games and had scores of 31 and 57.

raina was named captain and kohli vice-captain for the tri-series against sri lanka and zimbabwe in zimbabwe in mayâjune 2010, as many first-choice players skipped the tour. kohli made 168 runs at 42.00 including two fifties, but india suffered three defeats in four matches and crashed out of the series. during the series, kohli became the fastest indian batsman to reach 1,000 runs in odi cricket. he made his t20i debut against zimbabwe at harare and scored an unbeaten 26. later that month, kohli batted at 3 in a full-strength indian team throughout the 2010 asia cup and scored a total of 67 runs at an average of 16.75. his struggles with form continued in the tri-series against sri lanka and new zealand in sri lanka where he averaged 15.
despite the poor run of form, kohli was retained in the odi squad for a three-match series against australia in october, and in the only completed match of the series at visakhapatnam, scored his third odi centuryâ118 off 121 ballsâwhich helped india reach the target of 290 after losing the openers early. winning the man of the match, he admitted that he was under pressure to keep his place in the team after failures in the two previous series. part of a largely inexperienced team for the home odi series against new zealand, kohli scored a match-winning 104-ball 105, his fourth odi hundred and second in succession, in the first game, and followed it up with 64 and 63* in the next two matches. india completed a 5â0 whitewash of new zealand, while kohli's performance in the series helped him become a regular in the odi team and made him a strong contender for a spot in india's world cup squad. he was india's leading run-scorer in odis in 2010, with 995 runs from 25 matches at an average of 47.38 including three centuries.

kohli was india's leading run-getter in the five-match odi series of the south african tour in january 2011, with 193 runs at an average of 48.25 including two fifties, both in indian defeats. during the series, he jumped to number two spot on the icc rankings for odi batsmen, and was named in india's 15-man squad for the world cup. the inclusion of both kohli and raina in the world cup squad resulted in speculations about which of the two batsmen will make it to the playing eleven. days before india's first match of the tournament, indian captain dhoni indicated that the in-form kohli is likely to be preferred over raina.

kohli played in every match of india's successful world cup campaign. he scored an unbeaten 100, his fifth odi century, in the first match against bangladesh and became the first indian batsman to score a century on world cup debut. in the next four group matches he had low scores of 8, 34, 12 and 1 against england, ireland, netherlands and south africa respectively. having returned to form with 59 against the west indies, he scored only 24 and 9 in the quarter-final against australia and semi-final against pakistan respectively. in the final against sri lanka at mumbai, he scored 35, sharing an 83-run partnership with gambhir for the third wicket after india had lost both openers within the seventh over chasing 275. this partnership is regarded as ""one of the turning points in the match"", as india went on to win the match by six wickets and lift the world cup for the first time since 1983.

when india toured the west indies in juneâjuly 2011, they chose a largely inexperienced squad, resting tendulkar and others such as gambhir and sehwag missing out due to injuries. kohli was one of three uncapped players in the test squad. kohli found success in the odi series which india won 3â2, with a total of 199 runs at an average of 39.80. his best efforts came in the second odi at port of spain where he won the man of the match for his score of 81 which gave india a seven-wicket victory, and the fifth odi at kingston where his innings of 94 came in a seven-wicket defeat. kohli made his test debut at kingston in the first match of the test series that followed. he batted at 5 and was dismissed for 4 and 15 caught behind by fidel edwards in both innings. india went on to win the test series 1â0 but kohli amassed just 76 runs from five innings, struggling against the short ball and was particularly troubled by the fast bowling of edwards, who dismissed him three times in the series.

initially dropped from the test squad for india's four-match series in england in july and august, kohli was recalled as replacement for the injured yuvraj, though did not play in any match in the series. he found moderate success in the subsequent odi series in which he averaged 38.80. his score of 55 in the first odi at chester-le-street was followed by a string of low scores in the next three matches. in the last game of the series, kohli scored his sixth odi hundredâ107 runs off 93 ballsâand shared a 170-run third-wicket partnership with rahul dravid, who was playing his last odi, to help india post their first 300-plus total of the tour. kohli was dismissed hit wicket in that innings which was the only century in the series by any player on either team and earned him praise for his ""hard work"" and ""maturity"". however, england won the match by d/l method and the series 3â0.

in october 2011, kohli was the leading run-scorer of the five-match home odi series against england which india won 5â0. he scored a total of 270 runs across five matches including unbeaten knocks of 112 from 98 balls at delhi, where he put on an unbroken 209-run partnership with gambhir, and 86 at mumbai, both in successful run-chases. owing to his odi success, kohli was included, ahead of raina, in the test squad to face the west indies in november. in competition with yuvraj singh for the number six position, it was not until the final match of the series that kohli was selected in the team. he scored a pair of fifties in the match, with his first innings score of 52 ensuring india avoided follow-on. india won the subsequent odi series 4â1 in which kohli managed to accumulate 243 runs at 60.75. during the series, kohli scored his eighth odi century and his second at visakhapatnam, where he made 117 off 123 balls in india's run-chase of 271, a knock which raised his reputation as ""an expert of the chase"". kohli ended up as the leading run-getter in odis for the year 2011, with 1381 runs from 34 matches at 47.62 and four centuries. for his performances in 2011, he was named in the world odi xi by cricinfo.

having found a place in india's test squad for the tour of australia in december 2011, kohli top-scored with 132 in a tour match against cricket australia chairman's xi to strengthen his case for a spot in the playing eleven ahead of rohit sharma. batting at number 6, kohli failed to go past 25 in the first two tests, as his defensive technique was exposed. while fielding on the boundary during the second day of the second match, he gestured to the crowd with his middle finger for which he was fined 50% of his match fee by the match referee. he top-scored in each of india's innings in the third test at perth, with 44 and 75, even as india surrendered to their second consecutive innings defeat. in the fourth and final match at adelaide, kohli scored his maiden test century of 116 runs in the first innings; it was the only century scored by an indian in the series. india suffered a 0â4 whitewash and kohli, india's top run-scorer in the series, was described as ""the lone bright spot in an otherwise nightmare visit for the tourists"".
in the first seven matches of the commonwealth bank triangular series against hosts australia and sri lanka, kohli made two fiftiesâ77 at perth and 66 at brisbaneâboth against sri lanka. india registered two wins, a tie and four losses in these seven matches, which meant that they needed a bonus point win their last group match against sri lanka at hobart, to stay in contention for qualifying for the finals series. being set a target of 321 by sri lanka, kohli came to the crease with india's score at 86/2 and went on to score 133 not out from 86 balls to take india to a comfortable win with 13 overs to spare. india earned a bonus point with the win and kohli was named man of the match for his knock, which included scoring 24 runs in an over by lasith malinga. former australian cricketer and commentator dean jones rated kohli's innings as ""one of the greatest odi knocks of all time"". however, sri lanka beat australia three days later in their last group fixture and knocked india out of the series. with 373 runs at 53.28, kohli once again finished as india's highest run-scorer and lone centurion of the series.

kohli was appointed the vice-captain for the 2012 asia cup in bangladesh on the back of his fine performance in australia. kris srikkanth, the chairman of selectors, told reporters, ""hats off to virat kohli for the way he played. we have to start looking towards the future. the selection committee and the board felt kohli is future captaincy material."" kohli was in fine form during the tournament, finishing as the leading run-scorer with 357 runs at an average of 119. he scored 108 in the opening match against sri lanka in a 50-run indian victory, while india lost their next match to bangladesh in which he made 66. in the final group stage match against pakistan, he scored a personal best 183 off 148 balls, his 11th odi century. coming in at 0/1, he struck 22 fours and a six in his innings to help india to chase down 330, their highest successful odi run-chase at the time. his knock was the highest individual score in asia cup history, the joint-second highest score in an odi run-chase and the highest individual score against pakistan in odis surpassing previous record of 156 by brian lara. kohli was awarded the man of the match in both matches that india won, but india could not progress to the final of the tournament.

in julyâaugust 2012, kohli struck two centuries in the five-match odi tour of sri lankaâ106 off 113 balls at hambantota and 128* off 119 balls at colomboâwinning man of the match in both games. india won the series 4â1 and on account of scoring the most runs in the series, kohli was named player of the series. in the one-off t20i that followed, he scored a 48-ball 68, his first t20i fifty, and won the player of the series award. kohli scored his second test century at bangalore during new zealand's tour of india and won his first man of the match award in test cricket. india won the two-match series 2â0, and kohli averaged 106 with one hundred and two fifties from three innings. in the subsequent t20i series, he scored 70 runs off 41 balls, but india lost the match by one run and the series 1â0. he continued to be in good form during the 2012 icc world twenty20 in sri lanka, with 185 runs from 5 matches at an average of 46.25. he hit two fifties during the tournament, 50 against afghanistan in the group stage and 78* against pakistan in the super eights, winning man of the match for both innings. he was named in the 'team of the tournament' for the 2012 t20 world cup by the icc.

kohli's test form dipped during the first three matches of england's tour of india with a top score of 20 and england leading the series 2â1. he scored a patient 103 from 295 balls in the last match on a slow and low pitch at nagpur, keeping india in contention of drawing the series. ""espncricinfo"" praised kohli for having ""demonstrated his growing maturity to play just the sort of innings his side required"", while kohli described his knock as ""a learning innings"". however, the match ended in a draw and england won their first test series in india in 28 years. against pakistan in december 2012, kohli averaged 18 in the t20is and 4.33 in the odis, being troubled by the fast bowlers, particularly junaid khan, who dismissed him on all three occasions in the odi series. kohli had a quiet odi series against england, apart from a match-winning 77* in the third odi at ranchi, with a total of 155 runs at an average of 38.75.

for his performances in 2012, he was named in the world odi xi by the icc.
kohli scored his fourth test century (107) at chennai in the first match of the home test series against australia in february 2013. he said he was ""feeling hungry for this series"" after a poor run of form in the two previous series and also disappointed on getting out soon after reaching the hundred-run mark. india completed a 4â0 series sweep, becoming the first team to whitewash australia in more than four decades. kohli averaged 56.80 in the series and cemented his spot in the test team.
in june 2013, kohli featured in the icc champions trophy in england which india won. he scored a match-winning 144 against sri lanka in a warm-up match. he scored 34, 22 and 22 not out in india's group matches against south africa, west indies and pakistan respectively, while india qualified for the semi-finals with an undefeated record. in the semi-final against sri lanka at cardiff, he struck 58 not out in an eight-wicket win for india. the final between india and england at birmingham was reduced to 20 overs after a rain delay. india batted first and kohli top-scored with 43 from 34 balls, sharing a sixth-wicket partnership of 47 runs off 33 balls with ravindra jadeja and helping india reach 129/7 in 20 overs. india went on to secure a five-run win and their second consecutive icc odi tournament victory. he was also named as part of the 'team of the tournament' by the icc.

kohli stood-in as the captain for the first odi of the triangular series in the west indies after dhoni injured himself during the match. india lost the match by one wicket, and dhoni was subsequently ruled out of the series with kohli being named the captain for the remaining matches. in his second match as captain, kohli scored his first hundred as captain, making 102 off 83 balls against the west indies at port of spain in a bonus point win for india. many senior players including dhoni were rested for the five-match odi tour of zimbabwe in july 2013, with kohli being appointed captain for an entire series for the first time. in the first game of the series at harare, he struck 115 runs from 108 balls, helping india chase down the target of 229 and winning the man of the match award. he batted on two more occasions in the series in which he had scores of 14 and 58 not out. india completed a 5â0 sweep of the series; their first in an away odi series.

kohli had a successful time with the bat in the seven-match odi series against australia. after top-scoring with 61 in the opening loss at pune, he struck the fastest century by an indian in odis in the second match at jaipur. reaching the milestone in just 52 balls and putting up an unbroken 186-run second-wicket partnership with rohit sharma that came in 17.2 overs, kohli's innings of 100 not out helped india chase down the target of 360 for the loss of one wicket with more than six overs to spare. this chase was the second-highest successful run-chase in odi cricket, while kohli's knock became the fastest hundred against australia and the third-fastest in a run-chase. he followed that innings with 68 in the next match at mohali in another indian defeat, before the next two matches were washed out by rain. in the sixth odi at nagpur, he struck 115 off only 66 balls to help india successfully chase the target of 351 and level the series 2â2 and won the man of the match. he reached the 100-run mark in 61 balls, making it the third-fastest odi century by an indian batsman, and also became the fastest batsman in the world to score 17 hundreds in odi cricket. india clinched the series after winning the last match in which he was run out for a duck. at the conclusion of the series, kohli moved to the top position in the icc odi batsmen rankings for the first time in his career.

kohli batted twice in the two-match test series against the west indies, and had scores of 3 and 57 being dismissed by shane shillingford in both innings. this was also the last test series for tendulkar and kohli was expected to take tendulkar's number 4 batting position after the series. in the first game of the three-match odi series that followed at kochi, kohli made 86 to seal a six-wicket win and won the man of the match. during the match, he also equalled viv richards' record of becoming the fastest batsman to make 5,000 runs in odi cricket, reaching the landmark in his 114th innings. he missed out on his third century at visakhapatnam in the next match, after being dismissed for 99 playing a hook shot off ravi rampaul. india lost the match by two wickets, but took the series 2â1 after winning the last match at kanpur. with 204 runs at 68.00, kohli finished the series as the leading run-getter and was awarded the man of the series.

india toured south africa in december 2013 for three odis and two tests. kohli averaged 15.50 in the odis, including a duck. in the first test at johannesburg, playing his first test in south africa and batting at 4 for the first time, kohli scored 119 and 96. his hundred was the first by a subcontinent batsman at the venue since 1998. regarding kohli's hundred, south africa bowling coach allan donald said, ""the one word that comes to my mind is responsibility. i think he [kohli] showed great discipline and responsibility. it reminds me of sachin tendulkar when they came here in 1996."" the match ended in a draw, and kohli was awarded man of the match. india failed to win a single match on the tour, losing the second test by 10 wickets in which he made 46 and 11.
kohli continued to amass runs on the subsequent new zealand tour. he averaged 58.21 in the five-match odi series in which his efforts of 111-ball 123 at napier, 65-ball 78 at hamilton and 78-ball 82 at wellington all went in vain as india were defeated 4â0. he made 214 runs at 71.33 in the two-match test series that followed including an unbeaten 105 on the last day of the second test at wellington that helped india save the match.

india then travelled to bangladesh for the asia cup and world twenty20. dhoni was ruled out of the asia cup after suffering a side strain during the new zealand tour, which led to kohli being named the captain for the tournament. kohli scored 136 off 122 balls in india's opening match against bangladesh, sharing a 213-run third-wicket stand with ajinkya rahane, which helped india successfully chase 280. it was his 19th odi century and his fifth in bangladesh, making him the batsman with most odi centuries in bangladesh. india were knocked out of the tournament after narrow losses against sri lanka and pakistan, in which kohli scored 48 and 5 respectively.

dhoni returned from injury to captain the team for 2014 icc world twenty20 and kohli was named vice-captain. in india's opening match of the tournament against pakistan, kohli top-scored with 36 not out to guide india to a seven-wicket win. he scored 54 off 41 balls in the next game against west indies and an unbeaten 57 from 50 balls against bangladesh, both in successful run-chases. in the semi-final, he made an unbeaten 72 in 44 deliveries to help india achieve the target of 173 with six wickets and five balls to spare. he won the man of the match for this knock which he called ""my best t20 innings"". india posted 130/4 in the final against sri lanka, in which kohli scored 77 from 58 balls, and eventually lost the match by six wickets. kohli had made a total of 319 runs in the tournament at an average of 106.33, a record for most runs by an individual batsman in a single world twenty20 tournament, for which he won the man of the tournament award.

he was named in the 'team of the tournament' for the 2014 t20 world cup by the icc and cricinfo.

he next competed at the dubai tennis championships and lost to roger federer in the final. after 2 weeks, djokovic defeated john isner and andy murray en route to his 21st masters 1000 title, beating federer in three sets in indian wells. in miami, he defeated david ferrer and john isner en route to winning his fifth title defeating andy murray in three sets. with his 22nd masters title, djokovic became the first player to complete the indian wells â miami title sweep three times. in april, djokovic clinched his second monte-carlo masters by beating tomas berdych in the final. djokovic withdrew from the 2015 madrid masters. he won the title for the fourth time at the rome masters, making it 4 out of 4 titles in masters 1000 events entered by djokovic in 2015.
he continued his good form on clay at the french open, by reaching the final without dropping a set in the first five rounds, including a quarterfinal clash with nadal and a five set semi-final victory over no. 3 seed andy murray which took two days to complete. this meant he became only the second man to have won against nadal at the french open. however, he lost the next match and the tournament to no. 8 seed stan wawrinka in four sets, after having prevailed in the first set and being up a break in the fourth set and up 40â0 on wawrinka's serve in a subsequent game. he lost six of the final seven games of the match. with this loss, djokovic was denied his first victory at the french open and a personal career grand slam. five weeks later, he rebounded again from a tough loss in paris, just like 2014, coming from two sets down to beat kevin anderson in the fourth round, and then going on to claim his third wimbledon title in his fourth final at the all england club, with a four set win over roger federer.

prior to the final grand slam event of the year, djokovic had the chance to become the first man in history to complete the full set of masters 1000 titles in cincinnati, and reached the final for the fifth time, however he was once again beaten by federer, making it a fifth straight defeat in a cincinnati final. at the 2015 us open, djokovic reached the final for the sixth time in his career, achieving the feat of reaching all four grand slam finals in a single calendar year. in the final of the tournament, he faced federer once again, defeating him in four sets to win his third grand slam title of the year, his second title at flushing meadows, and his tenth career grand slam singles title, becoming the fifth man in the open era to win ten or more grand slam singles titles, as well as only the third man to reach all four major finals in a calendar year.

on 3 april 2016, djokovic won the 2016 miami open for the third consecutive year, and did so without dropping a set en route to his sixth career miami open title, tying him with andre agassi for most ever miami open men's singles titles. in addition, 2016 marked the third consecutive year that djokovic swept both indian wells and the miami open, the first male singles player to ever do that. this was also the fourth time in his career djokovic won both miami and indian wells back-to-back. his finals win in miami saw djokovic surpass roger federer to become the all-time leading prize money winner on the atp tour with career earnings of $98.2â million. after an early round exit at the monte carlo masters, djokovic quickly bounced back by winning the madrid title for the second time in his career with a three set victory over murray. they met again in the rome masters final one week later with murray the victor, despite a sluggish performance, djokovic defeated nadal and nishikori in two long quarterfinals and semi-finals.

""time"" included him on their list of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2014. as of september 2019, ronaldo is also the most followed user on instagram.
cristiano ronaldo dos santos aveiro was born in sã£o pedro, funchal, on the portuguese island of madeira, and grew up in santo antã³nio, funchal. he is the fourth and youngest child of maria dolores spinola dos santos da aveiro (b. 1954), a cook, and josã© dinis aveiro (1953â2005), a municipal gardener and a part-time kit man. his second given name, ""ronaldo"", was chosen after then-u.s. president ronald reagan. his great-grandmother on his father's side, isabel da piedade, was from the island of sã£o vicente, cape verde. he has one older brother, hugo (b. 1975), and two older sisters, elma (b. 1973) and liliana cã¡tia ""katia"" (b. 1977), who is a singer. ronaldo grew up in a catholic and impoverished home, sharing a room with all his siblings.

as a child, ronaldo played for amateur team andorinha from 1992 to 1995, where his father was the kit man, and later spent two years with nacional. in 1997, aged 12, he went on a three-day trial with sporting cp, who signed him for a fee of â£1,500. he subsequently moved from madeira to alcochete, near lisbon, to join sporting's other youth players at the club's football academy. by age 14, ronaldo believed he had the ability to play semi-professionally, and agreed with his mother to cease his education in order to focus entirely on football. while popular with other students at school, he had been expelled after throwing a chair at his teacher, who he said had ""disrespected"" him. however, one year later, he was diagnosed with a racing heart, a condition that could have forced him to give up playing football. ronaldo underwent heart surgery where a laser was used to cauterise multiple cardiac pathways into one, altering his resting heart rate. he was discharged from the hospital hours after the procedure and resumed training a few days later.

at age 16, ronaldo was promoted from sporting's youth team by first-team manager lã¡szlã³ bã¶lã¶ni, who was impressed with his dribbling. he subsequently became the first player to play for the club's under-16, under-17 and under-18 teams, the b team, and the first team, all within a single season. a year later, on 7 october 2002, ronaldo made his debut in the primeira liga, against moreirense, and scored two goals in their 3â0 win. over the course of the 2002â03 season, his representatives suggested the player to liverpool manager gã©rard houllier and barcelona president joan laporta. manager arsã¨ne wenger, who was interested in signing the winger, met with him at arsenal's grounds in november to discuss a possible transfer.

manchester united manager alex ferguson, however, determined to acquire ronaldo on a permanent move urgently, after sporting defeated united 3â1 at the inauguration of the estã¡dio josã© alvalade in august 2003. initially, united had just planned to sign ronaldo and then loan him back to sporting for a year. having been impressed by him, however, the manchester united players urged ferguson to sign him. after the game, ferguson agreed to pay sporting â£12.24 million for what he considered to be ""one of the most exciting young players"" he had ever seen. a decade after his departure from the club, in april 2013, sporting honoured ronaldo by selecting him to become their 100,000th member.

ronaldo became manchester united's first-ever portuguese player when he signed before the 2003â04 season. his transfer fee of â£12.24â million made him, at the time, the most expensive teenager in english football history. although he requested the number 28, his number at sporting, he received the number 7 shirt, which had previously been worn by such united players as george best, eric cantona and david beckham. wearing the number 7 became an extra source of motivation for ronaldo. a key element in his development during his time in england proved to be his manager, alex ferguson, of whom he later said, ""he's been my father in sport, one of the most important and influential factors in my career.""
ronaldo made his debut in the premier league in a 4â0 home victory over bolton wanderers on 16 august 2003, receiving a standing ovation when he came on as a 60th-minute substitute for nicky butt. his performance earned praise from george best, who hailed it as ""undoubtedly the most exciting debut"" he had ever seen. ronaldo scored his first goal for manchester united with a free-kick in a 3â0 win over portsmouth on 1 november. three other league goals followed in the second half of the campaign, the last of which came against aston villa on the final day of the season, a match in which he also received his first red card. ronaldo ended his first season in english football by scoring the opening goal in united's 3â0 victory over millwall in the fa cup final, earning his first trophy.

at the start of 2005, ronaldo played two of his best matches of the 2004â05 season, producing a goal and an assist against aston villa and scoring twice against rivals arsenal. he played the full 120 minutes of the decisive match against arsenal in the fa cup final, which ended in a goalless draw, and scored his attempt in the lost penalty shootout. he scored manchester united's 1000th premier league goal on 29 october, their only strike in a 4â1 loss to middlesbrough. midway through the season, in november, he signed a new contract which extended his previous deal by two years to 2010. ronaldo won his second trophy in english football, the football league cup, after scoring the third goal in united's 4â0 final victory over wigan athletic.

during his third season in england, ronaldo was involved in several incidents. he had a one-match ban imposed on him by uefa for a ""one-fingered gesture"" towards benfica fans, and was sent off in the manchester derbyâa 3â1 defeatâfor kicking manchester city's former united player andy cole. ronaldo clashed with a teammate, striker ruud van nistelrooy, who took offence at the winger's showboating style of play. following the 2006 fifa world cup, in which he was involved in an incident where club teammate wayne rooney was sent off, ronaldo publicly asked for a transfer, lamenting the lack of support he felt he had received from the club over the incident. united, however, denied the possibility of him leaving the club.

although his world cup altercation with rooney resulted in ronaldo being booed throughout the 2006â07 season, it proved to be his breakout year, as he broke the 20-goal barrier for the first time and won his first premier league title. an important factor in this success was his one-to-one training by first-team coach renã© meulensteen, who taught him to make himself more unpredictable, improve his teamwork, call for the ball, and capitalise on goalscoring opportunities rather than waiting for the chance to score the aesthetically pleasing goals for which he was already known. he scored three consecutive braces at the end of december, against aston villaâa victory which put united on top of the leagueâwigan athletic, and reading. ronaldo was named the premier league player of the month in november and december, becoming only the third player to receive consecutive honours.

at the quarter-final stage of the 2006â07 uefa champions league, ronaldo scored his first-ever goals in the competition, finding the net twice in a 7â1 victory over roma. he subsequently scored four minutes into the first semi-final leg against milan, which ended in a 3â2 win, but was marked out of the second leg as united lost 3â0 at the san siro. he also helped united reach the fa cup final, but the decisive match against chelsea ended in a 1â0 defeat. ronaldo scored the only goal in the manchester derby on 5 may 2007âhis 50th goal for the clubâas manchester united claimed their first premier league title in four years. as a result of his performances, he amassed a host of personal awards for the season. he won the professional footballers' association's player's player, fans' player, and young player of the year awards, as well as the football writers' association's footballer of the year award, becoming the first player to win all four main pfa and fwa honours. his club wages were concurrently upgraded to â£120,000 a week (â£31â million total) as part of a five-year contract extension with united. at the end of 2007, ronaldo was named runner-up to kakã¡ for the ballon d'or, and came third, behind kakã¡ and lionel messi, in the running for the fifa world player of the year award.

ronaldo scored his first and only hat-trick for manchester united in a 6â0 win against newcastle united on 12 january 2008, bringing united up to the top of the premier league table. a month later, on 19 march, he captained united for the first time in a home win over bolton, and scored both goals of the match. his second goal was his 33rd of the campaign, which bettered george best's total of 32 goals in the 1967â68 season, thus setting the club's new single-season record by a midfielder. his 31 league goals earned him the premier league golden boot, as well as the european golden shoe, which made him the first winger to win the latter award. he additionally received the pfa players' player of the year and fwa footballer of the year awards for the second consecutive season.

in the knockout stage of the champions league, ronaldo scored the decisive goal against lyon, which helped united advance to the quarter-finals 2â1 on aggregate, and, while playing as a striker, scored with a header in the 3â0 aggregate victory over roma. united advanced to the final against chelsea in moscow, where, despite his opening goal being negated by an equaliser and his penalty being saved in the shoot-out, manchester united emerged victorious. as the champions league top scorer, ronaldo was named the uefa club footballer of the year.

ronaldo scored a total of 42 goals in all competitions during the 2007â08 season, his most prolific campaign during his time in england. he missed three matches after headbutting a portsmouth player at the start of the season, an experience he said taught him not to let opponents provoke him. as rumours circulated of ronaldo's interest in moving to real madrid, united filed a tampering complaint with governing body fifa over madrid's alleged pursuit of their player, but they declined to take action. fifa president sepp blatter asserted that the player should be allowed to leave his club, describing the situation as ""modern slavery"". despite ronaldo publicly agreeing with blatter, he remained at united for another year.

ahead of the 2008â09 season, on 7 july, ronaldo underwent ankle surgery, which kept him out of action for 10 weeks. following his return, he scored his 100th goal in all competitions for united with the first of two free kicks in a 5â0 win against stoke city on 15 november, which meant he had now scored against all 19 opposition teams in the premier league at the time. at the close of 2008, ronaldo helped united win the fifa club world cup in japan, assisting the final-winning goal against liga de quito and winning the silver ball in the process. he subsequently became united's first ballon d'or winner since george best in 1968, and the first premier league player to be named the fifa world player of the year.

his match-winning goal in the second leg against porto, a 40-yard strike, earned him the inaugural fifa puskã¡s award, presented by fifa in recognition of the best goal of the year; he later called it the best goal he had ever scored. united advanced to the final in rome, where he made little impact in united's 2â0 defeat to barcelona. ronaldo ended his time in england with nine trophies, as united claimed their third successive premier league title and a football league cup. he finished the campaign with 26 goals in all competitions, 16 goals fewer than the previous season, in four more appearances. his final ever goal for manchester united came on 10 may 2009 with a free kick in the manchester derby at old trafford.

ahead of the 2009â10 season, ronaldo joined real madrid for a world record transfer fee at the time, of â£80â million (â¬94â million). his contract, which ran until 2015, was worth â¬11â million per year and contained a â¬1â billion buy-out clause. at least 80,000 fans attended his presentation at the santiago bernabã©u, surpassing the 25-year record of 75,000 fans who had welcomed diego maradona at napoli. since club captain raãºl already wore the number 7, the number ronaldo wore at manchester united, ronaldo received the number 9 shirt, which was presented to him by former madrid player alfredo di stã©fano.

ronaldo made his debut in la liga on 29 august 2009, against deportivo la coruã±a, and scored from the penalty spot in madrid's 3â2 home win. he scored in each of his first four league fixtures with the club, the first madrid player to do so. his first champions league goals for the club followed with two free kicks in the first group match against zã¼rich. his strong start to the season, however, was interrupted when he suffered an ankle injury in october while on international duty, which kept him sidelined for seven weeks. a week after his return, he received his first red card in spain in a match against almerã­a. midway through the season, ronaldo placed second in the running for the ballon d'or and the fifa world player of the year award, behind lionel messi of barcelona, madrid's historic rivals. he finished the campaign with 33 goals in all competitions, including a hat-trick in a 4â1 win against mallorca on 5 may 2010, his first in the spanish competition. his first season at real madrid ended trophyless.

following raãºl's departure, ronaldo was handed the number 7 shirt for real madrid before the 2010â11 season. his subsequent return to his ballon d'or-winning form was epitomised when, for the first time in his career, he scored four goals in a single match during a 6â1 rout against racing santander on 23 october. his haul concluded a goalscoring run of six consecutive matchesâthree in la liga, one in the champions league, and two for portugalâtotalling 11 goals, the most he had scored in a single month. ronaldo subsequently scored further hat-tricks against athletic bilbao, levante, villarreal, and mã¡laga. despite his performance, he did not make the podium for the inaugural fifa ballon d'or at the end of 2010.

during a historical series of four ""clã¡sicos"" against rivals barcelona in april 2011, ronaldo scored twice to equal his personal record of 42 goals in all competitions in a single season. although he failed to find the net during madrid's eventual elimination in the champions league semi-finals, he equalised from the penalty spot in the return league game and scored the match-winning goal in the 103rd minute of the copa del rey final, winning his first trophy in spain. over the next two weeks, ronaldo scored another four-goal haul against sevilla, a hat-trick against getafe, and a brace of free kicks against villarreal, taking his league total to 38 goals, which equalled the record for most goals scored in a season held by telmo zarra and hugo sã¡nchez. his two goals in the last match of the season, against almerã­a, made him the first player in la liga to score 40 goals. in addition to the pichichi trophy, ronaldo consequently won the european golden shoe for a second time, becoming the first player to win the award in two different leagues.

during the following campaign, the 2011â12 season, ronaldo surpassed his previous goalscoring feats to achieve a new personal best of 60 goals across all competitions. his 100th goal for real madrid came at camp nou in the supercopa de espaã±a, though barcelona claimed the trophy 5â4 on aggregate. he regained a place on the fifa ballon d'or podium, as runner-up to messi, after scoring hat-tricks against real zaragoza, rayo vallecano, mã¡laga, osasuna, and sevilla, the last of which put madrid on top of the league by the season's midway point. despite two goals from ronaldo, madrid were subsequently defeated by barcelona, 4â3, on aggregate in the quarter-finals of the copa del rey. he again scored twice, including a penalty, in the champions league semi-finals against bayern munich, resulting in a 3â3 draw, but his penalty kick in the shootout was saved by manuel neuer, leading to madrid's elimination.

ronaldo found greater team success in the league, as he helped real madrid win their first la liga title in four years, with a record 100 points. following a hat-trick against levante, further increasing madrid's lead over barcelona, he scored his 100th league goal for madrid in a 5â1 win over real sociedad on 24 march 2012, a milestone he reached in just 92 matches across three seasons, breaking the previous club record held by ferenc puskã¡s. another hat-trick in the madrid derby against atlã©tico madrid brought his total to 40 league goals, equalling his record of the previous season. on 21 april ronaldo scored the winner in a 2â1 victory over barcelona at the camp nou, which saw him mocking the hostile crowd with a ""calm down"" gesture during his goal celebration â a celebration he would repeat against barca four years later. his final league goal of the campaign, against mallorca, took his total to 46 goals, four short of the new record set by messi, and earned him the distinction of being the first player to score against all 19 opposition teams in a single season in la liga.

ronaldo began the 2012â13 season by lifting the supercopa de espaã±a, his third trophy in spain. with a goal in each leg by the portuguese, madrid won the spanish super cup on away goals following a 4â4 aggregate draw against barcelona. although ronaldo publicly commented that he was unhappy with a ""professional issue"" within the club, prompted by his refusal to celebrate his 150th goal for madrid, his goalscoring rate did not suffer. after netting a hat-trick, including two penalties, against deportivo la coruã±a, he scored his first hat-trick in the champions league in a 4â1 victory over ajax. four days later, he became the first player to score in six successive ""clã¡sicos"" when he hit a brace in a 2â2 draw at camp nou. his performances in 2012 again saw ronaldo voted second in the running for the fifa ballon d'or, finishing runner-up to four-time winner messi.

following the 2012â13 winter break, ronaldo captained real madrid for the first time in an official match, scoring a brace to lift 10-man madrid to a 4â3 victory over real sociedad on 6 january. he subsequently became the first non-spanish player in 60 years to captain madrid in ""el clã¡sico"" on 30 january, a match which also marked his 500th club appearance. three days prior, he had scored his 300th club goal as part of a perfect hat-trick against getafe. he scored his 200th goal for real madrid on 8 may in a 6â2 win against mã¡laga, reaching the landmark in 197 games. he helped madrid reach the copa del rey final by scoring twice in ""el clã¡sico"", which marked the sixth successive match at camp nou in which he had scored, a real madrid record. in the final, he headed the opening goal of an eventual 2â1 defeat to atlã©tico madrid, but was shown a red card for violent conduct. in the first knockout round of the champions league, ronaldo faced his former club manchester united for the first time. after scoring the equaliser in a 1â1 draw at the santiago bernabã©u, he scored the match-winning goal in a 2â1 victory at old trafford, his first return to his former home ground. he did not celebrate scoring against his former club as a mark of respect. after scoring three goals against galatasaray in the quarters, he scored madrid's only goal in the 4â1 away defeat to borussia dortmund in the semi-finals, but failed to increase his side's 2â0 victory in the second leg, as they were eliminated at the semi-final stage for the third consecutive year.

at the start of the 2013â14 season, ronaldo signed a new contract that extended his stay by three years to 2018, with a salary of â¬17â million net, making him briefly the highest-paid player in football. he was joined at the club by winger gareth bale, whose world record transfer fee of â¬100â million surpassed the fee madrid had paid for ronaldo four years prior. together with striker karim benzema, they formed an attacking trio popularly dubbed ""bbc"", an acronym of bale, benzema, and cristiano, and a play off the name of the public service broadcaster. by late november, ronaldo had scored 32 goals from 22 matches for both club and country, including hat-tricks against galatasaray, sevilla, real sociedad, northern ireland, and sweden. he ended 2013 with 69 goals in 59 appearances, his highest year-end goal tally. he received the fifa ballon d'or, an amalgamation of the ballon d'or and the fifa world player of the year award, for the first time in his career.

concurrently with his individual achievements, ronaldo enjoyed his greatest team success in spain to date, as he helped real madrid win ""la dã©cima"", their tenth european cup. in the knockout phase of the competition, he scored a brace in each leg of a 9â2 aggregate win against schalke 04, helping madrid advance to the quarter-finals. his goal in a 3â0 home win over borussia dortmundâhis 100th champions league matchâtook his total for the season to 14 goals, equalling the record messi had set two years before. after hitting a brace in a 4â0 defeat of bayern munich at the allianz arena, he scored from the penalty spot in the 120th minute of the 4â1 final victory over atlã©tico madrid, becoming the first player to score in two european cup finals for two different winning teams. his overall performance in the final was subdued as a result of patellar tendinitis and related hamstring problems, which had plagued him in the last months of the campaign. ronaldo played the final against medical advice, later commenting: ""in your life you do not win without sacrifices and you must take risks."" as the champions league top goalscorer for the third time, with a record 17 goals, he was named the uefa best player in europe.

in the copa del rey, ronaldo helped madrid reach the final by scoring two penalties against atlã©tico madrid at the vicente calderã³n, the first of which meant he had now scored in every single minute of a 90-minute football match. his continued issues with his knee and thigh caused him to miss the final, where real madrid defeated barcelona 2â1 to claim the trophy. ronaldo scored 31 goals in 30 league games, which earned him the pichichi and the european golden shoe, receiving the latter award jointly with liverpool striker luis suã¡rez. among his haul was his 400th career goal, in 653 appearances for club and country, which came with a brace against celta vigo on 6 january; he dedicated his goals to compatriot eusã©bio, who had died two days before. a last-minute, backheeled volley scored against valencia on 4 mayâhis 50th goal in all competitionsâwas recognised as the best goal of the season by the liga de fãºtbol profesional, which additionally named ronaldo the best player in la liga.

after portugal's unsuccessful performance in the european championship, luiz felipe scolari was replaced as coach by carlos queiroz, formerly the assistant manager at united. queiroz made ronaldo the squad's permanent captain in july 2008. ronaldo failed to score a single goal in the qualification for the 2010 world cup, as portugal narrowly avoided a premature elimination from the tournament with a play-off victory over bosnia and herzegovina. in the group stage of the world cup, he was named man of the match in all three matches against ivory coast, north korea, and brazil. his only goal of the tournament came in their 7â0 rout of north korea, which marked his first international goal in 16 months. portugal's world cup ended with a 1â0 loss against eventual champions spain in the round of 16.

ronaldo scored seven goals in the qualification for euro 2012, including two strikes against bosnia and herzegovina in the play-offs, to send portugal into the tournament, where they were drawn in a ""group of death"". in the last group stage game against the netherlands, ronaldo scored twice to secure a 2â1 victory. he scored a header in the quarter-final against the czech republic to give his team a 1â0 win. in both games against the netherlands and the czech republic he was named man of the match. after the semi-finals against spain ended scoreless, with ronaldo having sent three shots over the bar, portugal were eliminated in the penalty shootout. ronaldo did not take a penalty as he had been slated to take the unused fifth slot, a decision that drew criticism. as the joint top scorer with three goals, alongside five other players, he was again included in the team of the tournament.

during the qualification for the 2014 world cup, ronaldo scored a total of eight goals. a qualifying match on 17 october 2012, a 1â1 draw against northern ireland, earned him his 100th cap. his first international hat-trick also came against northern ireland, when he found the net three times in a 15-minute spell of a 4â2 qualifying victory on 6 september 2013. after portugal failed to qualify during the regular campaign, ronaldo scored all four of the team's goals in the play-offs against sweden, which ensured their place at the tournament. his hat-trick in the second leg took his international tally to 47 goals, equaling pauleta's record. ronaldo subsequently scored twice in a 5â1 friendly win over cameroon on 5 march 2014 to become his country's all-time top scorer.

ronaldo took part in the tournament despite suffering from patellar tendinitis and a related thigh injury, potentially risking his career. ronaldo later commented: ""if we had two or three cristiano ronaldos in the team i would feel more comfortable. but we don't."" despite ongoing doubts over his fitness, being forced to abort practice twice, ronaldo played the full 90 minutes of the opening match against germany, though he was unable to prevent a 4â0 defeat. after assisting an injury-time 2â2 equaliser against the united states, he scored a late match-winning goal in a 2â1 victory over ghana. his 50th international goal made him the first portuguese to play and score in three world cups. portugal were eliminated from the tournament at the close of the group stage on goal difference.
ronaldo scored five goals, including a hat-trick against armenia, in the qualification for euro 2016. with the only goal in another victory over armenia on 14 november 2014, he reached 23 goals in the european championship, including qualifying matches, to become the competition's all-time leading goalscorer. at the start of the tournament, however, ronaldo failed to convert his chances in portugal's draws against iceland and austria, despite taking a total of 20 shots on goal. in the latter match, he overtook luã­s figo as his nation's most capped player with his 128th international appearance, which ended scoreless after he missed a penalty in the second half. with two goals and an assist in the last match of the group stage, a 3â3 draw against hungary, ronaldo became the first player to score in four european championships, having made a record 17 appearances in the tournament. though placed third in their group behind hungary and iceland, his team qualified for the knockout round as a result of the competition's newly expanded format.

in portugal's first knockout match, ronaldo's only attempt on goal was parried by croatia's goalkeeper into the path of ricardo quaresma, whose finish then secured a 1â0 victory late in extra time. after his team progressed past poland on penalties, ronaldo became the first player to participate in three european championship semi-finals; he scored the opening goal and assisted a second in a 2â0 win against wales, equaling michel platini as the competition's all-time top scorer with nine goals. in the final against hosts france, ronaldo was forced off after just 25 minutes following a challenge from dimitri payet. after multiple treatments and attempts to play on, he was stretchered off the pitch and replaced by quaresma. during extra time, substitute eder scored in the 109th minute to earn portugal a 1â0 victory. as team captain, ronaldo later lifted the trophy in celebration of his country's first-ever triumph in a major tournament. he was awarded the silver boot as the joint second-highest goalscorer, with three goals and three assists, and was named to the team of the tournament for the third time in his career.

following the euro 2016 success, ronaldo scored six goals in the opening rounds of the 2018 fifa world cup qualifiers with four being against andorra and two against latvia. these goals brought his international tally to 68 goals, putting level with gerd mã¼ller and robbie keane as the fourth-highest european international goalscorer of all-time. he played his first professional match on his home island of madeira on 28 march 2017 at age 32, opening a 2â3 friendly defeat to sweden at the estã¡dio dos barreiros. with the goal, he tied with miroslav klose on 71 goals as the third-highest scoring european in international football.

in portugal's opening match of the 2017 fifa confederations cup against mexico on 17 june, cristiano ronaldo set-up quaresma's opening goal in a 2â2 draw. three days later, he scored in a 1â0 win over hosts russia. on 24 june, he scored from a penalty in a 4â0 win over new zealand, which saw portugal top their group and advance to the semi-finals of the competition. with his 75th international goal, ronaldo also equalled sã¡ndor kocsis as the second-highest european international goalscorer of all-time, behind only ferenc puskã¡s. he was named man of the match in all three of portugal's group stage matches. ronaldo left the competition early: after chile defeated portugal 3â0 on penalties in the semi-finals, he was allowed to return home to be with his newborn children. therefore, he missed portugal's third-place play-off match in which portugal defeated mexico 2â1 after extra time.

on 31 august 2017, ronaldo scored a hat-trick in a 5â1 win in a world cup qualifier over the faroe islands, which saw him overtake pelã© and equal hussein saeed as the joint-fifth-highest goalscorer in international football with 78 goals. these goals brought his tally in the 2018 world cup qualifiers to 14, equalling predrag mijatoviä's record for most goals in a single uefa senior men's qualifying campaign, and also saw him break the record for the most goals scored in a single european qualifying group, overtaking the previous record of 13 goals set by david healy and robert lewandowski. ronaldo's hat-trick took his world cup qualifying goals total to 29, making him the highest scorer in european world cup qualifiers, ahead of andriy shevchenko, and the highest goalscorer in world cup qualifying and finals matches combined, with 32 goals, ahead of miroslav klose. ronaldo later added to this tally by scoring a goal against andorra in a 2â0 victory.

in the build-up to the 2018 world cup, portugal hosted friendlies against tunisia, belgium and algeria. ronaldo featured in the final of the three matches in which he made his 150th international appearance. on 15 june 2018, ronaldo became the oldest player ever to score a hat-trick in a world cup match, helping portugal secure a 3â3 draw against spain in their opening match at the world cup. in doing so, he also became the first portuguese player to score a goal in four world cups and one of four players to do so in total. his third goal saw him curl in a 30-yard free kick with two minutes remaining for the equaliser. his hat-trick also drew him level with ferenc puskã¡s as the highest european goalscorer of all-time, with 84 international goals. in portugal's second game on 20 june, ronaldo scored the only goal in a 1â0 victory against morocco, breaking puskã¡s' record. in the final group match against iran on 25 june, ronaldo missed a penalty in an eventual 1â1 draw which saw portugal progress to the second round as group runners-up behind spain. on 30 june, portugal were eliminated following a 2â1 defeat to uruguay in the last 16. for his performances throughout the tournament, ronaldo was later named to the 2018 fifa world cup dream team.

after the 2018 fifa world cup, ronaldo missed six international matches, including the entire league phase of the 2018â19 uefa nations league. ronaldo played for hosts portugal in the inaugural nations league finals in june 2019. in the semi-finals on 5 june, he scored a hat-trick against switzerland to secure a spot in the final. upon netting the match's opening goal, he became the first player to score in 10 consecutive international competitions, breaking the record of nine he previously shared with ghana's asamoah gyan. in the final of the tournament four days later, portugal defeated netherlands 1â0.

on 10 september, ronaldo scored four goals in a 5â1 away win over lithuania in a euro 2020 qualifying match; in the process, he overtook robbie keane (23 goals) as the player with most goals in the uefa european championship qualifiers, setting a new record with 25 goals. on that occasion, ronaldo also set a new record as the player who scored against the most national teams, 40, while also completing his eighth international hat-trick. on 14 october, he scored his 700th senior career goal for club and country from the penalty spot, in his 974th senior career appearance, a 2â1 away loss to ukraine in a euro 2020 qualifier.

a versatile attacker, ronaldo is capable of playing on either wing as well as through the centre of the pitch, and, while ostensibly right-footed, is very strong with both feet. he ranks among the world's fastest footballers, both with and without the ball. tactically, ronaldo has undergone several evolutions throughout his career. while at sporting and during his first season at manchester united, he was typically deployed as a traditional winger on the right side of midfield, where he regularly looked to deliver crosses into the penalty area. in this position, he was able to use his pace and acceleration, agility, and technical skills to take on opponents in one-on-one situations. ronaldo became noted for his dribbling and flair, often displaying an array of tricks and feints, such as the step overs and so-called 'chops' that became his trademark.
as ronaldo matured, he underwent a major physical transformation, developing a muscular body type that allows him to retain possession of the ball, and strong legs that make up for an outstanding jumping ability. his strength and jumping ability, combined with his elevation, heading accuracy, and height of , gives him an edge in winning aerial challenges for balls. these attributes allow him to function as a target-man, and make him an aerial goal threat in the penalty area; consequently, many of his goals have been headers. allied with his increased stamina and work-rate, his goalscoring ability improved drastically on the left wing where he was given the positional freedom to move into the centre to finish attacks. he also increasingly played a creative role for his team, often dropping deep to pick up the ball, participate in the build-up of plays, and create chances for his teammates, courtesy of his good vision and passing ability.

in his final seasons at united, ronaldo played an even more attacking and central role, functioning both as a striker and as a supporting forward, or even as an attacking midfielder on occasion. he developed into a prolific goalscorer, capable of finishing well both inside the penalty area and from distance with an accurate and powerful shot, courtesy of his striking ability. an accurate penalty kick taker, he also became a set piece specialist, renowned for his powerful, bending free kicks, though his ability in this regard deteriorated later on in his career. when taking free kicks, ronaldo is known for using the ""knuckleball"" technique, which had previously been popularised by juninho pernambucano; he also adopts a trademark stance before striking the ball, which involves him standing with his legs far apart. regarding cristiano ronaldo's unique style of taking free kicks, former manchester united assistant manager mike phelan has commented: ""people used to put the ball down, walk away, run up and hit it. he brought in a more dynamic showmanship. he places the ball down, the concentration level is high, he takes his certain amount of steps back so that his standing foot is in the perfect place to hit the ball in the sweet spot. he is the ultimate showman. he has that slight arrogance. when he pulls those shorts up and shows his thighs, he is saying 'all eyes on me' and this is going in. he understands the marketing side of it. the way he struts up and places it; the world is watching him.""
at real madrid, ronaldo continued to play a more offensive role, while his creative and defensive duties became more limited, although not entirely diminished. initially deployed as a centre forward, he was later moved back onto the left wing, though in a free tactical role; this position allowed him to drift into the centre at will to get onto the end of crosses and score, or draw out defenders with his movement off the ball and leave space for teammates to exploit. madrid's counter-attacking style of play also allowed him to become a more efficient and consistent player, as evidenced by his record-breaking goalscoring feats. however, while he mainly drew praise in the media for his prolific goalscoring, he also demonstrated his ability as an effective creator in this role. from 2013 onwards, he effectively adapted his style to the physical effects of ageing with increasingly reduced off the ball movement and general involvement, completing fewer dribbles and passes per game, and instead focusing on short-distance creating and goalscoring. since 2017, ronaldo has adapted his style of play yet again to become more of a free-roaming centre forward, a role in which he has continued to excel and maintain a prolific goalscoring record; in this position, he has earned praise in the media for his intelligent movement both on and off the ball, his excellent positional sense, link-up play, clinical finishing, and his opportunism, as well as his ability to lose or anticipate his markers, find space in the box, and score from few opportunities.

in his first season at juventus, ronaldo continued to play in a variety of different attacking roles, depending on whom he was partnered with. while he had occupied an increasingly offensive role in his final years at real madrid, at times he functioned in a free role at juventus, either as a lone striker or in his trademark role on the left wing, in a 4â2â3â1 or 4â3â3 formation, in which he often switched positions with mario mandå¾ukiä. in this role, he was also given licence to drop deep or even out wide onto the right flank in order to receive the ball, and be more involved in the build-up of plays; as such, aside from scoring goals himself, he began to take on opponents and create chances for other players with greater frequency than he had in his final seasons with real madrid. off the ball, he was also capable of creating space for teammates with his movement and attacking runs into the box, or finishing off chances with his head or feet by getting onto the end of his teammates' crosses. on occasion he also played in an attacking partnership alongside mandå¾ukiä in a 4â3â1â2, 4â4â2, or 3â5â2 formation. he continued to play a similar role in his second season with the club.

ronaldo is widely regarded as one of the two best players of his generation, alongside lionel messi. after winning his first ballon d'or by a record-high vote count at age 23, the public debate regarding his qualities as a player moved beyond his status in contemporary football to the possibility that he was one of the greatest players in history. acclaimed for his prolific and consistent goal-scoring, he is considered a decisive player who is also a game changer, especially in important and high-pressured situations.
ronaldo is noted for his work ethic, elite body conditioning, and dedication to improvement on the training pitch, as well being regarded as a natural leader. writing of his ""extraordinary commitment to physical preparation"", adam bate of sky sports adds, ""dedication is a huge part of staying at the top and ronaldo's focus is perhaps unparalleled within the game."" his drive and determination to succeed are fuelled by a desire to be talked about alongside pelã© and diego maradona once retiring. he has at times, however, been criticised for simulating when tackled. in addition to this, he was occasionally criticised early in his career by manager alex ferguson, teammates, and the media for being a selfish or overly flamboyant player.

during his career, ronaldo has also been described as having an ""arrogant image"" on the pitch, with ronaldo stating that he had become a ""victim"" because of how he was portrayed in the media. he is often seen moaning, gesticulating and scowling while trying to inspire his team to victory, with ronaldo insisting that his competitive nature should not be mistaken for arrogance. his managers, teammates and various journalists have commented that this reputation has caused an unfair image of him. in 2014, ronaldo told ""france football"" that he had made a ""mistake"" when he said in 2011, ""people are jealous of me as i am rich, handsome and a great player"", adding that he had matured since then and fans understood him better.

ronaldo has adopted several goalscoring celebrations throughout his career, including one particular celebration which gained widespread coverage in the media, when he squatted and stared directly into a camera on the sidelines of the pitch with his hand on his chin. however, after scoring a goal, he usually celebrates with a ""storming jump"" and ""turn"", before ""landing in spread-eagled fashion"" into his ""signature power stance"", while usually simultaneously exclaiming ""sã­"" (spanish for ""yes""); as such, this trademark celebration has been dubbed the ""sii!"" in the media.

both players have scored in at least two uefa champions league finals and have regularly broken the 50-goal barrier in a single season. sports journalists and pundits regularly argue the individual merits of both players in an attempt to argue who they believe is the best player in modern football. it has been compared to sports rivalries such as the muhammad aliâjoe frazier rivalry in boxing, the borgâmcenroe rivalry in tennis, and the ayrton sennaâalain prost rivalry from formula one motor racing.

some commentators choose to analyse the differing physiques and playing styles of the two, while part of the debate revolves around the contrasting personalities of the two players: ronaldo is sometimes depicted as an arrogant and theatrical showoff, while messi is portrayed as a shy, humble character.

in a 2012 interview, ronaldo commented on the rivalry, saying ""i think we push each other sometimes in the competition, this is why the competition is so high"", while ronaldo's manager during his time at manchester united, alex ferguson, opined that ""i don't think the rivalry against each other bothers them. i think they have their own personal pride in terms of wanting to be the best"". messi himself denied any rivalry, saying that it was ""only the media, the press, who wants us to be at loggerheads but i've never fought with cristiano"". responding to the claims that he and messi do not get on well on a personal level, ronaldo commented, ""we don't have a relationship outside the world of football, just as we don't with a lot of other players"", before adding that in years to come he hopes they can laugh about it together, stating; ""we have to look on this rivalry with a positive spirit, because it's a good thing."" representing archrivals barcelona and real madrid, the two players faced each other at least twice every season in the world's biggest club game, ""el clã¡sico"", which is among the world's most viewed annual sporting events.

in a debate at oxford union in october 2013, when asked whether fifa president sepp blatter preferred messi or ronaldo, blatter paid tribute to the work ethic of the argentine before taking a swipe at ronaldo, claiming ""one of them has more expenses for the hairdresser than the other"". real madrid demanded â and promptly received â a full apology, and the portuguese issued his own riposte with a mock-salute celebration after scoring a penalty against sevilla, after blatter had described him as a ""commander"" on the pitch. in august 2019, ronaldo and messi were interviewed while sat next to each other prior to the announcement of the uefa men's player of the year, with ronaldo stating, ""of course, we have a good relationship. we haven't had dinner together yet, but i hope in the future. i pushed him and he pushed me as well. so it's good to be part of the history of football.""

as his reputation grew from his time at manchester united, ronaldo has signed many sponsorship deals for consumer products, including sportswear, football boots (since november 2012 ronaldo has worn the nike mercurial vapor personalized cr7 edition), soft drinks, clothing, automotive lubricants, financial services, electronics and computer video games. ronaldo was featured as the cover athlete of ea sports' ""fifa"" video game ""fifa 18"" and was heavily involved in the game's promotion. his 'siiii' goal celebration features in the ""fifa"" series, accompanied with his own voiceover. he was also the face of ""pro evolution soccer"", appearing on the cover in 2008, 2012 and 2013.

""forbes"" has twice ranked ronaldo first on its list of the world's highest-paid football players; his combined income from salaries, bonuses and endorsements was $73â million in 2013â14 and $79â million in 2014â15. the latter earnings saw him listed behind only boxer floyd mayweather, jr. on the magazine's list of the world's highest-paid athletes. in 2016, he became the first footballer to top the ""forbes"" list of highest-earning athletes, with a total income of $88â million from his salary and endorsements in 2015â16. he topped the list for the second straight year with earnings of $93â million in 2016â17. ronaldo is one of the world's most marketable athletes: ""sportspro"" rated him the fifth most marketable athlete in 2012, and eighth most marketable athlete in 2013, with brazilian footballer neymar topping both lists. sports market research company repucom named ronaldo the most marketable and most recognised football player in the world in may 2014. he was additionally named in the 2014 time 100, ""time""s annual list of the most influential people in the world. espn named ronaldo the world's most famous athlete in 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019.
ronaldo has established a strong online presence; the most popular sportsperson on social media, he counted 158â million total followers across facebook, twitter and instagram by june 2015. , he has the world's biggest facebook fanbase with 103â million followers: he became the first sportsperson to reach 50â million followers in august 2010, and in october 2014, he became the first sportsperson, and the second person after shakira, to reach 100â million followers. by june 2017, ronaldo had 277â million followers across social media. his sponsors earned $936â million in media value across his social media accounts between june 2016 to june 2017. ronaldo has released two mobile apps: in december 2011, he launched an iphone game called ""heads up with cristiano"", created by developer rocklive, and in december 2013, he launched ""viva ronaldo"", a dedicated social networking website and mobile app. computer security company mcafee produced a 2012 report ranking footballers by the probability of an internet search for their name leading to an unsafe website, with ronaldo's name first on the list.

ronaldo's life and person have been the subject of several works. his autobiography, titled ""moments"", was published in december 2007. his sponsor castrol produced the television film ""ronaldo: tested to the limit"", in which he is physically and mentally tested in several areas; his physical performance was consequently subject to scrutiny by world media upon the film's release in september 2011. """", a documentary narrated by the actor benedict cumberbatch, was released via vimeo in june 2014. a documentary film about his life and career, titled ""ronaldo"", was released worldwide on 9 november 2015. directed by bafta-winner anthony wonke, the film is produced and distributed by universal pictures, while asif kapadia is the executive producer.
a replica cristiano ronaldo jersey has been a much sought after sports product throughout his career. in 2008, ronaldo's number 7 manchester united jersey was the best-selling sports product under the auspices of the premier league. in 2018, within 24 hours of his number 7 juventus jersey being released, over 520,000 had been sold, with $62.4 million generated in one day.

ronaldo opened his first fashion boutique under the name ""cr7"" (his initials and shirt number) on the island of madeira, portugal, in 2006. ronaldo expanded his business with a second clothes boutique in lisbon in 2008. in partnership with scandinavian manufacturer jbs textile group and the new york fashion designer richard chai, ronaldo co-designed a range of underwear and sock line, released in november 2013. he later expanded his ""cr7"" fashion brand by launching a line of premium shirts and shoes by july 2014. in september 2015, ronaldoâin a partnership with eden parfumsâreleased his own fragrance, ""legacy"".

max planck,"
max karl ernst ludwig planck, formemrs (; ; 23 april 1858 â 4 october 1947) was a german theoretical physicist whose discovery of energy quanta won him the nobel prize in physics in 1918.

planck made many contributions to theoretical physics, but his fame as a physicist rests primarily on his role as the originator of quantum theory, which revolutionized human understanding of atomic and subatomic processes. in 1948, the german scientific institution the kaiser wilhelm society (of which planck was twice president) was renamed the max planck society (mps). the mps now includes 83 institutions representing a wide range of scientific directions.

planck came from a traditional, intellectual family. his paternal great-grandfather and grandfather were both theology professors in gã¶ttingen; his father was a law professor at the university of kiel and munich. one of his uncles was also a judge.
planck was born in kiel, holstein, to johann julius wilhelm planck and his second wife, emma patzig. he was baptized with the name of ""karl ernst ludwig marx planck""; of his given names, ""marx"" (a now obsolete variant of ""markus"" or maybe simply an error for ""max"", which is actually short for ""maximilian"") was indicated as the ""appellation name"". however, by the age of ten he signed with the name ""max"" and used this for the rest of his life.

he was the 6th child in the family, though two of his siblings were from his father's first marriage. war was common during planck's early years and among his earliest memories was the marching of prussian and austrian troops into kiel during the second schleswig war in 1864. in 1867 the family moved to munich, and planck enrolled in the maximilians gymnasium school, where he came under the tutelage of hermann mã¼ller, a mathematician who took an interest in the youth, and taught him astronomy and mechanics as well as mathematics. it was from mã¼ller that planck first learned the principle of conservation of energy. planck graduated early, at age 17. this is how planck first came in contact with the field of physics.

planck was gifted when it came to music. he took singing lessons and played piano, organ and cello, and composed songs and operas. however, instead of music he chose to study physics.
the munich physics professor philipp von jolly advised planck against going into physics, saying, ""in this field, almost everything is already discovered, and all that remains is to fill a few holes."" planck replied that he did not wish to discover new things, but only to understand the known fundamentals of the field, and so began his studies in 1874 at the university of munich. under jolly's supervision, planck performed the only experiments of his scientific career, studying the diffusion of hydrogen through heated platinum, but transferred to theoretical physics.

in 1877 he went to the friedrich wilhelms university in berlin for a year of study with physicists hermann von helmholtz and gustav kirchhoff and mathematician karl weierstrass. he wrote that helmholtz was never quite prepared, spoke slowly, miscalculated endlessly, and bored his listeners, while kirchhoff spoke in carefully prepared lectures which were dry and monotonous. he soon became close friends with helmholtz. while there he undertook a program of mostly self-study of clausius's writings, which led him to choose thermodynamics as his field.

in october 1878 planck passed his qualifying exams and in february 1879 defended his dissertation, ""ãber den zweiten hauptsatz der mechanischen wã¤rmetheorie"" (""on the second law of thermodynamics""). he briefly taught mathematics and physics at his former school in munich.

by the year 1880, planck had obtained the two highest academic degrees offered in europe. the first was a doctorate degree after he completed his paper detailing his research and theory of thermodynamics. he then presented his thesis called ""gleichgewichtszustã¤nde isotroper kã¶rper in verschiedenen temperaturen"" (""equilibrium states of isotropic bodies at different temperatures""), which earned him a habilitation.

with the completion of his habilitation thesis, planck became an unpaid privatdozent (german academic rank comparable to lecturer/assistant professor) in munich, waiting until he was offered an academic position. although he was initially ignored by the academic community, he furthered his work on the field of heat theory and discovered one after another the same thermodynamical formalism as gibbs without realizing it. clausius's ideas on entropy occupied a central role in his work.

in april 1885 the university of kiel appointed planck as associate professor of theoretical physics. further work on entropy and its treatment, especially as applied in physical chemistry, followed. he published his ""treatise on thermodynamics"" in 1897. he proposed a thermodynamic basis for svante arrhenius's theory of electrolytic dissociation.

in 1889 he was named the successor to kirchhoff's position at the friedrich-wilhelms-universitã¤t in berlin â presumably thanks to helmholtz's intercession â and by 1892 became a full professor. in 1907 planck was offered boltzmann's position in vienna, but turned it down to stay in berlin. during 1909, as a university of berlin professor, he was invited to become the ernest kempton adams lecturer in theoretical physics at columbia university in new york city. a series of his lectures were translated and co-published by columbia university professor a. p. wills. he retired from berlin on 10 january 1926, and was succeeded by erwin schrã¶dinger.

in march 1887 planck married marie merck (1861â1909), sister of a school fellow, and moved with her into a sublet apartment in kiel. they had four children: karl (1888â1916), the twins emma (1889â1919) and grete (1889â1917), and erwin (1893â1945).

after the apartment in berlin, the planck family lived in a villa in berlin-grunewald, wangenheimstrasse 21. several other professors from university of berlin lived nearby, among them theologian adolf von harnack, who became a close friend of planck. soon the planck home became a social and cultural center. numerous well-known scientists, such as albert einstein, otto hahn and lise meitner were frequent visitors. the tradition of jointly performing music had already been established in the home of helmholtz.

after several happy years, in july 1909 marie planck died, possibly from tuberculosis. in march 1911 planck married his second wife, marga von hoesslin (1882â1948); in december his fifth child hermann was born.

during the first world war planck's second son erwin was taken prisoner by the french in 1914, while his oldest son karl was killed in action at verdun. grete died in 1917 while giving birth to her first child. her sister died the same way two years later, after having married grete's widower. both granddaughters survived and were named after their mothers. planck endured these losses stoically.

in january 1945, erwin, to whom he had been particularly close, was sentenced to death by the nazi volksgerichtshof because of his participation in the failed attempt to assassinate hitler in july 1944. erwin was executed on 23 january 1945.

as a professor at the friedrich-wilhelms-universitã¤t in berlin, planck joined the local physical society. he later wrote about this time: ""in those days i was essentially the only theoretical physicist there, whence things were not so easy for me, because i started mentioning entropy, but this was not quite fashionable, since it was regarded as a mathematical spook"". thanks to his initiative, the various local physical societies of germany merged in 1898 to form the german physical society (deutsche physikalische gesellschaft, dpg); from 1905 to 1909 planck was the president.

planck started a six-semester course of lectures on theoretical physics, ""dry, somewhat impersonal"" according to lise meitner, ""using no notes, never making mistakes, never faltering; the best lecturer i ever heard"" according to an english participant, james r. partington, who continues: ""there were always many standing around the room. as the lecture-room was well heated and rather close, some of the listeners would from time to time drop to the floor, but this did not disturb the lecture"". planck did not establish an actual ""school""; the number of his graduate students was only about 20, among them:


in 1894 planck turned his attention to the problem of black-body radiation. he had been commissioned by electric companies to create maximum light from lightbulbs with minimum energy. the problem had been stated by kirchhoff in 1859: ""how does the intensity of the electromagnetic radiation emitted by a black body (a perfect absorber, also known as a cavity radiator) depend on the frequency of the radiation (i.e., the color of the light) and the temperature of the body?"". the question had been explored experimentally, but no theoretical treatment agreed with experimental values. wilhelm wien proposed wien's law, which correctly predicted the behaviour at high frequencies, but failed at low frequencies. the rayleighâjeans law, another approach to the problem, agreed with experimental results at low frequencies, but created what was later known as the ""ultraviolet catastrophe"" at high frequencies. however, contrary to many textbooks this was not a motivation for planck.

planck's first proposed solution to the problem in 1899 followed from what planck called the ""principle of elementary disorder"", which allowed him to derive wien's law from a number of assumptions about the entropy of an ideal oscillator, creating what was referred-to as the wienâplanck law. soon it was found that experimental evidence did not confirm the new law at all, to planck's frustration. planck revised his approach, deriving the first version of the famous planck black-body radiation law, which described the experimentally observed black-body spectrum well. it was first proposed in a meeting of the dpg on 19 october 1900 and published in 1901. this first derivation did not include energy quantisation, and did not use statistical mechanics, to which he held an aversion. in november 1900, planck revised this first approach, relying on boltzmann's statistical interpretation of the second law of thermodynamics as a way of gaining a more fundamental understanding of the principles behind his radiation law. as planck was deeply suspicious of the philosophical and physical implications of such an interpretation of boltzmann's approach, his recourse to them was, as he later put it, ""an act of despair ... i was ready to sacrifice any of my previous convictions about physics.""

the central assumption behind his new derivation, presented to the dpg on 14 december 1900, was the supposition, now known as the planck postulate, that electromagnetic energy could be emitted only in quantized form, in other words, the energy could only be a multiple of an elementary unit:

where is planck's constant, also known as planck's action quantum (introduced already in 1899), and is the frequency of the radiation. note that the elementary units of energy discussed here are represented by and not simply by . physicists now call these quanta photons, and a photon of frequency will have its own specific and unique energy. the total energy at that frequency is then equal to multiplied by the number of photons at that frequency.
at first planck considered that quantisation was only ""a purely formal assumption ... actually i did not think much about it...""; nowadays this assumption, incompatible with classical physics, is regarded as the birth of quantum physics and the greatest intellectual accomplishment of planck's career (ludwig boltzmann had been discussing in a theoretical paper in 1877 the possibility that the energy states of a physical system could be discrete). the discovery of planck's constant enabled him to define a new universal set of physical units (such as the planck length and the planck mass), all based on fundamental physical constants upon which much of quantum theory is based. in recognition of planck's fundamental contribution to a new branch of physics, he was awarded the nobel prize in physics for 1918 (he actually received the award in 1919).

subsequently, planck tried to grasp the meaning of energy quanta, but to no avail. ""my unavailing attempts to somehow reintegrate the action quantum into classical theory extended over several years and caused me much trouble."" even several years later, other physicists like rayleigh, jeans, and lorentz set planck's constant to zero in order to align with classical physics, but planck knew well that this constant had a precise nonzero value. ""i am unable to understand jeans' stubbornness â he is an example of a theoretician as should never be existing, the same as hegel was for philosophy. so much the worse for the facts if they don't fit.""

max born wrote about planck: ""he was, by nature, a conservative mind; he had nothing of the revolutionary and was thoroughly skeptical about speculations. yet his belief in the compelling force of logical reasoning from facts was so strong that he did not flinch from announcing the most revolutionary idea which ever has shaken physics.""

in 1905, the three epochal papers by albert einstein were published in the journal ""annalen der physik"". planck was among the few who immediately recognized the significance of the special theory of relativity. thanks to his influence, this theory was soon widely accepted in germany. planck also contributed considerably to extend the special theory of relativity. for example, he recast the theory in terms of classical action.

einstein's hypothesis of light ""quanta"" (photons), based on heinrich hertz's 1887 discovery (and further investigation by philipp lenard) of the photoelectric effect, was initially rejected by planck. he was unwilling to discard completely maxwell's theory of electrodynamics. ""the theory of light would be thrown back not by decades, but by centuries, into the age when christiaan huygens dared to fight against the mighty emission theory of isaac newton ...""

in 1910, einstein pointed out the anomalous behavior of specific heat at low temperatures as another example of a phenomenon which defies explanation by classical physics. planck and nernst, seeking to clarify the increasing number of contradictions, organized the first solvay conference (brussels 1911). at this meeting einstein was able to convince planck.

meanwhile, planck had been appointed dean of berlin university, whereby it was possible for him to call einstein to berlin and establish a new professorship for him (1914). soon the two scientists became close friends and met frequently to play music together.

at the onset of the first world war planck endorsed the general excitement of the public, writing that, ""besides much that is horrible, there is also much that is unexpectedly great and beautiful: the smooth solution of the most difficult domestic political problems by the unification of all parties (and) ... the extolling of everything good and noble.""

nonetheless, planck refrained from the extremes of nationalism. in 1915, at a time when italy was about to join the allied powers, he voted successfully for a scientific paper from italy, which received a prize from the prussian academy of sciences, where planck was one of four permanent presidents.

planck also signed the infamous ""manifesto of the 93 intellectuals"", a pamphlet of polemic war propaganda (while einstein retained a strictly pacifistic attitude which almost led to his imprisonment, being spared by his swiss citizenship). but in 1915 planck, after several meetings with dutch physicist lorentz, revoked parts of the manifesto. then in 1916 he signed a declaration against german annexationism.

in the turbulent post-war years, planck, now the highest authority of german physics, issued the slogan ""persevere and continue working"" to his colleagues.

in october 1920 he and fritz haber established the ""notgemeinschaft der deutschen wissenschaft"" (emergency organization of german science), aimed at providing financial support for scientific research. a considerable portion of the money the organization would distribute was raised abroad.

planck also held leading positions at berlin university, the prussian academy of sciences, the german physical society and the kaiser wilhelm society (which in 1948 became the max planck society). during this time economic conditions in germany were such that he was hardly able to conduct research. in 1926 planck became a foreign member of the royal netherlands academy of arts and sciences.

during the interwar period, planck became a member of the deutsche volks-partei (german people's party), the party of nobel peace prize laureate gustav stresemann, which aspired to liberal aims for domestic policy and rather revisionistic aims for politics around the world.

planck disagreed with the introduction of universal suffrage and later expressed the view that the nazi dictatorship resulted from ""the ascent of the rule of the crowds"".

at the end of the 1920s bohr, heisenberg and pauli had worked out the copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, but it was rejected by planck, and by schrã¶dinger, laue, and einstein as well. planck expected that wave mechanics would soon render quantum theoryâhis own childâunnecessary. this was not to be the case, however. further work only cemented quantum theory, even against his and einstein's philosophical revulsions. planck experienced the truth of his own earlier observation from his struggle with the older views in his younger years: ""a new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die, and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it.""

when the nazis came to power in 1933, planck was 74. he witnessed many jewish friends and colleagues expelled from their positions and humiliated, and hundreds of scientists emigrate from nazi germany. again he tried to ""persevere and continue working"" and asked scientists who were considering emigration to remain in germany. nevertheless, he did help his nephew, the economist hermann kranold, to emigrate to london after his arrest. he hoped the crisis would abate soon and the political situation would improve.

otto hahn asked planck to gather well-known german professors in order to issue a public proclamation against the treatment of jewish professors, but planck replied, ""if you are able to gather today 30 such gentlemen, then tomorrow 150 others will come and speak against it, because they are eager to take over the positions of the others."" under planck's leadership, the kaiser wilhelm society (kwg) avoided open conflict with the nazi regime, except concerning fritz haber. planck tried to discuss the issue with adolf hitler but was unsuccessful. in the following year, 1934, haber died in exile.

one year later, planck, having been the president of the kwg since 1930, organized in a somewhat provocative style an official commemorative meeting for haber. he also succeeded in secretly enabling a number of jewish scientists to continue working in institutes of the kwg for several years. in 1936, his term as president of the kwg ended, and the nazi government pressured him to refrain from seeking another term.

as the political climate in germany gradually became more hostile, johannes stark, prominent exponent of deutsche physik (""german physics"", also called ""aryan physics"") attacked planck, sommerfeld and heisenberg for continuing to teach the theories of einstein, calling them ""white jews"". the ""hauptamt wissenschaft"" (nazi government office for science) started an investigation of planck's ancestry, claiming that he was ""1/16 jewish"", but planck himself denied it.
in 1938, planck celebrated his 80th birthday. the dpg held a celebration, during which the max-planck medal (founded as the highest medal by the dpg in 1928) was awarded to french physicist louis de broglie. at the end of 1938, the prussian academy lost its remaining independence and was taken over by nazis (""gleichschaltung""). planck protested by resigning his presidency. he continued to travel frequently, giving numerous public talks, such as his talk on religion and science, and five years later he was sufficiently fit to climb 3,000-metre peaks in the alps.

during the second world war the increasing number of allied bombing missions against berlin forced planck and his wife to temporarily leave the city and live in the countryside. in 1942 he wrote: ""in me an ardent desire has grown to persevere this crisis and live long enough to be able to witness the turning point, the beginning of a new rise."" in february 1944 his home in berlin was completely destroyed by an air raid, annihilating all his scientific records and correspondence. his rural retreat was threatened by the rapid advance of the allied armies from both sides.

in 1944, planck's son erwin was arrested by the gestapo following the attempted assassination of hitler in the 20 july plot. he was tried and sentenced to death by the people's court in october 1944. erwin was hanged at berlin's plã¶tzensee prison in january 1945. the death of his son destroyed much of planck's will to live. after the end of the war planck, his second wife, and his son by her were brought to a relative in gã¶ttingen, where planck died on october 4, 1947. his grave is situated in the old stadtfriedhof (city cemetery) in gã¶ttingen.

planck was a member of the lutheran church in germany. he was very tolerant towards alternative views and religions.
in a lecture in 1937 entitled ""religion und naturwissenschaft"" (religion and natural science) he suggested the importance of these symbols and rituals related directly with a believer's ability to worship god, but that one must be mindful that the symbols provide an imperfect illustration of divinity. he criticized atheism for being focused on the derision of such symbols, while at the same time warned of the over-estimation of the importance of such symbols by believers.

planck was tolerant and favorable to all religions. although he remained in the lutheran church, he did not promote christian or biblical views. he believed ""the faith in miracles must yield, step by step, before the steady and firm advance of the facts of science, and its total defeat is undoubtedly a matter of time."" 

in his 1937 lecture ""religion and naturwissenschaft,"" planck expressed the view that god is everywhere present, and held that ""the holiness of the unintelligible godhead is conveyed by the holiness of symbols."" atheists, he thought, attach too much importance to what are merely symbols. he was a churchwarden from 1920 until his death, and believed in an almighty, all-knowing, beneficent god (though not necessarily a personal one). both science and religion wage a ""tireless battle against skepticism and dogmatism, against unbelief and superstition"" with the goal ""toward god!""

planck said in 1944, ""as a man who has devoted his whole life to the most clear headed science, to the study of matter, i can tell you as a result of my research about atoms this much: there is no matter as such. all matter originates and exists only by virtue of a force which brings the particle of an atom to vibration and holds this most minute solar system of the atom together. we must assume behind this force the existence of a conscious and intelligent spirit (orig. geist). this spirit is the matrix of all matter.""

planck regarded the scientist as a man of imagination and christian faith. he said: ""both religion and science require a belief in god. for believers, god is in the beginning, and for physicists he is at the end of all considerationsâ¦ to the former he is the foundation, to the latter, the crown of the edifice of every generalized world view"".

on the other hand, planck wrote, ""...'to believe' means 'to recognize as a truth,' and the knowledge of nature, continually advancing on incontestably safe tracks, has made it utterly impossible for a person possessing some training in natural science to recognize as founded on truth the many reports of extraordinary occurrences contradicting the laws of nature, of miracles which are still commonly regarded as essential supports and confirmations of religious doctrines, and which formerly used to be accepted as facts pure and simple, without doubt or criticism. the belief in miracles must retreat step by step before relentlessly and reliably progressing science and we cannot doubt that sooner or later it must vanish completely.""

later in life, planck's views on god were that of a deist. for example, six months before his death a rumour started that he had converted to catholicism, but when questioned what had brought him to make this step, he declared that, although he had always been deeply religious, he did not believe ""in a personal god, let alone a christian god.""

"
niels bohr,"
niels henrik david bohr (; 7 october 1885â â 18 november 1962) was a danish physicist who made foundational contributions to understanding atomic structure and quantum theory, for which he received the nobel prize in physics in 1922. bohr was also a philosopher and a promoter of scientific research.

bohr developed the bohr model of the atom, in which he proposed that energy levels of electrons are discrete and that the electrons revolve in stable orbits around the atomic nucleus but can jump from one energy level (or orbit) to another. although the bohr model has been supplanted by other models, its underlying principles remain valid. he conceived the principle of complementarity: that items could be separately analysed in terms of contradictory properties, like behaving as a wave or a stream of particles. the notion of complementarity dominated bohr's thinking in both science and philosophy.

bohr founded the institute of theoretical physics at the university of copenhagen, now known as the niels bohr institute, which opened in 1920. bohr mentored and collaborated with physicists including hans kramers, oskar klein, george de hevesy, and werner heisenberg. he predicted the existence of a new zirconium-like element, which was named hafnium, after the latin name for copenhagen, where it was discovered. later, the element bohrium was named after him.

during the 1930s, bohr helped refugees from nazism. after denmark was occupied by the germans, he had a famous meeting with heisenberg, who had become the head of the german nuclear weapon project. in september 1943, word reached bohr that he was about to be arrested by the germans, and he fled to sweden. from there, he was flown to britain, where he joined the british tube alloys nuclear weapons project, and was part of the british mission to the manhattan project. after the war, bohr called for international cooperation on nuclear energy. he was involved with the establishment of cern and the research establishment risã¸ of the danish atomic energy commission and became the first chairman of the nordic institute for theoretical physics in 1957.

bohr was born in copenhagen, denmark, on 7 october 1885, the second of three children of christian bohr, a professor of physiology at the university of copenhagen, and ellen adler bohr, who came from a wealthy danish jewish family prominent in banking and parliamentary circles. he had an elder sister, jenny, and a younger brother harald. jenny became a teacher, while harald became a mathematician and footballer who played for the danish national team at the 1908 summer olympics in london. niels was a passionate footballer as well, and the two brothers played several matches for the copenhagen-based akademisk boldklub (academic football club), with niels as goalkeeper.
bohr was educated at gammelholm latin school, starting when he was seven. in 1903, bohr enrolled as an undergraduate at copenhagen university. his major was physics, which he studied under professor christian christiansen, the university's only professor of physics at that time. he also studied astronomy and mathematics under professor thorvald thiele, and philosophy under professor harald hã¸ffding, a friend of his father.

in 1905, a gold medal competition was sponsored by the royal danish academy of sciences and letters to investigate a method for measuring the surface tension of liquids that had been proposed by lord rayleigh in 1879. this involved measuring the frequency of oscillation of the radius of a water jet. bohr conducted a series of experiments using his father's laboratory in the university; the university itself had no physics laboratory. to complete his experiments, he had to make his own glassware, creating test tubes with the required elliptical cross-sections. he went beyond the original task, incorporating improvements into both rayleigh's theory and his method, by taking into account the viscosity of the water, and by working with finite amplitudes instead of just infinitesimal ones. his essay, which he submitted at the last minute, won the prize. he later submitted an improved version of the paper to the royal society in london for publication in the ""philosophical transactions of the royal society"".

harald became the first of the two bohr brothers to earn a master's degree, which he earned for mathematics in april 1909. niels took another nine months to earn his on the electron theory of metals, a topic assigned by his supervisor, christiansen. bohr subsequently elaborated his master's thesis into his much-larger doctor of philosophy (dr. phil.) thesis. he surveyed the literature on the subject, settling on a model postulated by paul drude and elaborated by hendrik lorentz, in which the electrons in a metal are considered to behave like a gas. bohr extended lorentz's model, but was still unable to account for phenomena like the hall effect, and concluded that electron theory could not fully explain the magnetic properties of metals. the thesis was accepted in april 1911, and bohr conducted his formal defence on 13 may. harald had received his doctorate the previous year. bohr's thesis was groundbreaking, but attracted little interest outside scandinavia because it was written in danish, a copenhagen university requirement at the time. in 1921, the dutch physicist hendrika johanna van leeuwen would independently derive a theorem from bohr's thesis that is today known as the bohrâvan leeuwen theorem.
in 1910, bohr met margrethe nã¸rlund, the sister of the mathematician niels erik nã¸rlund. bohr resigned his membership in the church of denmark on 16 april 1912, and he and margrethe were married in a civil ceremony at the town hall in slagelse on 1 august. years later, his brother harald similarly left the church before getting married. bohr and margrethe had six sons. the oldest, christian, died in a boating accident in 1934, and another, harald, died from childhood meningitis. aage bohr became a successful physicist, and in 1975 was awarded the nobel prize in physics, like his father. became a physician; , a chemical engineer; and ernest, a lawyer. like his uncle harald, ernest bohr became an olympic athlete, playing field hockey for denmark at the 1948 summer olympics in london.

in september 1911, bohr, supported by a fellowship from the carlsberg foundation, travelled to england. at the time, it was where most of the theoretical work on the structure of atoms and molecules was being done. he met j. j. thomson of the cavendish laboratory and trinity college, cambridge. he attended lectures on electromagnetism given by james jeans and joseph larmor, and did some research on cathode rays, but failed to impress thomson. he had more success with younger physicists like the australian william lawrence bragg, and new zealand's ernest rutherford, whose 1911 small central nucleus rutherford model of the atom had challenged thomson's 1904 plum pudding model. bohr received an invitation from rutherford to conduct post-doctoral work at victoria university of manchester, where bohr met george de hevesy and charles galton darwin (whom bohr referred to as ""the grandson of the real darwin"").

bohr returned to denmark in july 1912 for his wedding, and travelled around england and scotland on his honeymoon. on his return, he became a ""privatdocent"" at the university of copenhagen, giving lectures on thermodynamics. martin knudsen put bohr's name forward for a ""docent"", which was approved in july 1913, and bohr then began teaching medical students. his three papers, which later became famous as ""the trilogy"", were published in ""philosophical magazine"" in july, september and november of that year. he adapted rutherford's nuclear structure to max planck's quantum theory and so created his bohr model of the atom.

planetary models of atoms were not new, but bohr's treatment was. taking the 1912 paper by darwin on the role of electrons in the interaction of alpha particles with a nucleus as his starting point, he advanced the theory of electrons travelling in orbits around the atom's nucleus, with the chemical properties of each element being largely determined by the number of electrons in the outer orbits of its atoms. he introduced the idea that an electron could drop from a higher-energy orbit to a lower one, in the process emitting a quantum of discrete energy. this became a basis for what is now known as the old quantum theory.

in 1885, johann balmer had come up with his balmer series to describe the visible spectral lines of a hydrogen atom:
where î» is the wavelength of the absorbed or emitted light and ""r"" is the rydberg constant. balmer's formula was corroborated by the discovery of additional spectral lines, but for thirty years, no one could explain why it worked. in the first paper of his trilogy, bohr was able to derive it from his model:
where ""m"" is the electron's mass, ""e"" is its charge, ""h"" is planck's constant and ""z"" is the atom's atomic number (1 for hydrogen).

the model's first hurdle was the pickering series, lines which did not fit balmer's formula. when challenged on this by alfred fowler, bohr replied that they were caused by ionised helium, helium atoms with only one electron. the bohr model was found to work for such ions. many older physicists, like thomson, rayleigh and hendrik lorentz, did not like the trilogy, but the younger generation, including rutherford, david hilbert, albert einstein, enrico fermi, max born and arnold sommerfeld saw it as a breakthrough. the trilogy's acceptance was entirely due to its ability to explain phenomena which stymied other models, and to predict results that were subsequently verified by experiments. today, the bohr model of the atom has been superseded, but is still the best known model of the atom, as it often appears in high school physics and chemistry texts.

bohr did not enjoy teaching medical students. he decided to return to manchester, where rutherford had offered him a job as a reader in place of darwin, whose tenure had expired. bohr accepted. he took a leave of absence from the university of copenhagen, which he started by taking a holiday in tyrol with his brother harald and aunt hanna adler. there, he visited the university of gã¶ttingen and the ludwig maximilian university of munich, where he met sommerfeld and conducted seminars on the trilogy. the first world war broke out while they were in tyrol, greatly complicating the trip back to denmark and bohr's subsequent voyage with margrethe to england, where he arrived in october 1914. they stayed until july 1916, by which time he had been appointed to the chair of theoretical physics at the university of copenhagen, a position created especially for him. his docentship was abolished at the same time, so he still had to teach physics to medical students. new professors were formally introduced to king christian x, who expressed his delight at meeting such a famous football player.

in april 1917, bohr began a campaign to establish an institute of theoretical physics. he gained the support of the danish government and the carlsberg foundation, and sizeable contributions were also made by industry and private donors, many of them jewish. legislation establishing the institute was passed in november 1918. now known as the niels bohr institute, it opened on 3 march 1921, with bohr as its director. his family moved into an apartment on the first floor. bohr's institute served as a focal point for researchers into quantum mechanics and related subjects in the 1920s and 1930s, when most of the world's best known theoretical physicists spent some time in his company. early arrivals included hans kramers from the netherlands, oskar klein from sweden, george de hevesy from hungary, wojciech rubinowicz from poland and svein rosseland from norway. bohr became widely appreciated as their congenial host and eminent colleague. klein and rosseland produced the institute's first publication even before it opened.
the bohr model worked well for hydrogen, but could not explain more complex elements. by 1919, bohr was moving away from the idea that electrons orbited the nucleus and developed heuristics to describe them. the rare-earth elements posed a particular classification problem for chemists, because they were so chemically similar. an important development came in 1924 with wolfgang pauli's discovery of the pauli exclusion principle, which put bohr's models on a firm theoretical footing. bohr was then able to declare that the as-yet-undiscovered element 72 was not a rare-earth element, but an element with chemical properties similar to those of zirconium. he was immediately challenged by the french chemist georges urbain, who claimed to have discovered a rare-earth element 72, which he called ""celtium"". at the institute in copenhagen, dirk coster and george de hevesy took up the challenge of proving bohr right and urbain wrong. starting with a clear idea of the chemical properties of the unknown element greatly simplified the search process. they went through samples from copenhagen's museum of mineralogy looking for a zirconium-like element and soon found it. the element, which they named hafnium (""hafnia"" being the latin name for copenhagen) turned out to be more common than gold.

in 1922, bohr was awarded the nobel prize in physics ""for his services in the investigation of the structure of atoms and of the radiation emanating from them"". the award thus recognised both the trilogy and his early leading work in the emerging field of quantum mechanics. for his nobel lecture, bohr gave his audience a comprehensive survey of what was then known about the structure of the atom, including the correspondence principle, which he had formulated. this states that the behaviour of systems described by quantum theory reproduces classical physics in the limit of large quantum numbers.

the discovery of compton scattering by arthur holly compton in 1923 convinced most physicists that light was composed of photons, and that energy and momentum were conserved in collisions between electrons and photons. in 1924, bohr, kramers and john c. slater, an american physicist working at the institute in copenhagen, proposed the bohrâkramersâslater theory (bks). it was more a programme than a full physical theory, as the ideas it developed were not worked out quantitatively. bks theory became the final attempt at understanding the interaction of matter and electromagnetic radiation on the basis of the old quantum theory, in which quantum phenomena were treated by imposing quantum restrictions on a classical wave description of the electromagnetic field.

modelling atomic behaviour under incident electromagnetic radiation using ""virtual oscillators"" at the absorption and emission frequencies, rather than the (different) apparent frequencies of the bohr orbits, led max born, werner heisenberg and kramers to explore different mathematical models. they led to the development of matrix mechanics, the first form of modern quantum mechanics. the bks theory also generated discussion of, and renewed attention to, difficulties in the foundations of the old quantum theory. the most provocative element of bks â that momentum and energy would not necessarily be conserved in each interaction, but only statistically â was soon shown to be in conflict with experiments conducted by walther bothe and hans geiger. in light of these results, bohr informed darwin that ""there is nothing else to do than to give our revolutionary efforts as honourable a funeral as possible"".

the introduction of spin by george uhlenbeck and samuel goudsmit in november 1925 was a milestone. the next month, bohr travelled to leiden to attend celebrations of the 50th anniversary of hendrick lorentz receiving his doctorate. when his train stopped in hamburg, he was met by wolfgang pauli and otto stern, who asked for his opinion of the spin theory. bohr pointed out that he had concerns about the interaction between electrons and magnetic fields. when he arrived in leiden, paul ehrenfest and albert einstein informed bohr that einstein had resolved this problem using relativity. bohr then had uhlenbeck and goudsmit incorporate this into their paper. thus, when he met werner heisenberg and pascual jordan in gã¶ttingen on the way back, he had become, in his own words, ""a prophet of the electron magnet gospel"".

heisenberg first came to copenhagen in 1924, then returned to gã¶ttingen in june 1925, shortly thereafter developing the mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics. when he showed his results to max born in gã¶ttingen, born realised that they could best be expressed using matrices. this work attracted the attention of the british physicist paul dirac, who came to copenhagen for six months in september 1926. austrian physicist erwin schrã¶dinger also visited in 1926. his attempt at explaining quantum physics in classical terms using wave mechanics impressed bohr, who believed it contributed ""so much to mathematical clarity and simplicity that it represents a gigantic advance over all previous forms of quantum mechanics"".

when kramers left the institute in 1926 to take up a chair as professor of theoretical physics at the utrecht university, bohr arranged for heisenberg to return and take kramers's place as a ""lektor"" at the university of copenhagen. heisenberg worked in copenhagen as a university lecturer and assistant to bohr from 1926 to 1927.

bohr became convinced that light behaved like both waves and particles, and in 1927, experiments confirmed the de broglie hypothesis that matter (like electrons) also behaved like waves. he conceived the philosophical principle of complementarity: that items could have apparently mutually exclusive properties, such as being a wave or a stream of particles, depending on the experimental framework. he felt that it was not fully understood by professional philosophers.

in copenhagen in 1927 heisenberg developed his uncertainty principle, which bohr embraced. in a paper he presented at the volta conference at como in september 1927, he demonstrated that the uncertainty principle could be derived from classical arguments, without quantum terminology or matrices. einstein preferred the determinism of classical physics over the probabilistic new quantum physics to which he himself had contributed. philosophical issues that arose from the novel aspects of quantum mechanics became widely celebrated subjects of discussion. einstein and bohr had good-natured arguments over such issues throughout their lives.

in 1914, carl jacobsen, the heir to carlsberg breweries, bequeathed his mansion to be used for life by the dane who had made the most prominent contribution to science, literature or the arts, as an honorary residence (). harald hã¸ffding had been the first occupant, and upon his death in july 1931, the royal danish academy of sciences and letters gave bohr occupancy. he and his family moved there in 1932. he was elected president of the academy on 17 march 1939.

by 1929, the phenomenon of beta decay prompted bohr to again suggest that the law of conservation of energy be abandoned, but enrico fermi's hypothetical neutrino and the subsequent 1932 discovery of the neutron provided another explanation. this prompted bohr to create a new theory of the compound nucleus in 1936, which explained how neutrons could be captured by the nucleus. in this model, the nucleus could be deformed like a drop of liquid. he worked on this with a new collaborator, the danish physicist fritz kalckar, who died suddenly in 1938.

the discovery of nuclear fission by otto hahn in december 1938 (and its theoretical explanation by lise meitner) generated intense interest among physicists. bohr brought the news to the united states where he opened the fifth washington conference on theoretical physics with fermi on 26 january 1939. when bohr told george placzek that this resolved all the mysteries of transuranic elements, placzek told him that one remained: the neutron capture energies of uranium did not match those of its decay. bohr thought about it for a few minutes and then announced to placzek, lã©on rosenfeld and john wheeler that ""i have understood everything."" based on his liquid drop model of the nucleus, bohr concluded that it was the uranium-235 isotope and not the more abundant uranium-238 that was primarily responsible for fission with thermal neutrons. in april 1940, john r. dunning demonstrated that bohr was correct. in the meantime, bohr and wheeler developed a theoretical treatment which they published in a september 1939 paper on ""the mechanism of nuclear fission"".

bohr read the 19th-century danish christian existentialist philosopher, sã¸ren kierkegaard. richard rhodes argued in ""the making of the atomic bomb"" that bohr was influenced by kierkegaard through hã¸ffding. in 1909, bohr sent his brother kierkegaard's ""stages on life's way"" as a birthday gift. in the enclosed letter, bohr wrote, ""it is the only thing i have to send home; but i do not believe that it would be very easy to find anything betterâ ... i even think it is one of the most delightful things i have ever read."" bohr enjoyed kierkegaard's language and literary style, but mentioned that he had some disagreement with kierkegaard's philosophy. some of bohr's biographers suggested that this disagreement stemmed from kierkegaard's advocacy of christianity, while bohr was an atheist.

there has been some dispute over the extent to which kierkegaard influenced bohr's philosophy and science. david favrholdt argued that kierkegaard had minimal influence over bohr's work, taking bohr's statement about disagreeing with kierkegaard at face value, while jan faye argued that one can disagree with the content of a theory while accepting its general premises and structure.

the rise of nazism in germany prompted many scholars to flee their countries, either because they were jewish or because they were political opponents of the nazi regime. in 1933, the rockefeller foundation created a fund to help support refugee academics, and bohr discussed this programme with the president of the rockefeller foundation, max mason, in may 1933 during a visit to the united states. bohr offered the refugees temporary jobs at the institute, provided them with financial support, arranged for them to be awarded fellowships from the rockefeller foundation, and ultimately found them places at institutions around the world. those that he helped included guido beck, felix bloch, james franck, george de hevesy, otto frisch, hilde levi, lise meitner, george placzek, eugene rabinowitch, stefan rozental, erich ernst schneider, edward teller, arthur von hippel and victor weisskopf.

in april 1940, early in the second world war, nazi germany invaded and occupied denmark. to prevent the germans from discovering max von laue's and james franck's gold nobel medals, bohr had de hevesy dissolve them in aqua regia. in this form, they were stored on a shelf at the institute until after the war, when the gold was precipitated and the medals re-struck by the nobel foundation. bohr's own medal had been donated to an auction to the fund for finnish relief, and was auctioned off in march of 1940, along with the medal of august krogh. the buyer later donated the two medals to the danish historical museum in frederiksborg castle, where they are still kept.

bohr kept the institute running, but all the foreign scholars departed.

bohr was aware of the possibility of using uranium-235 to construct an atomic bomb, referring to it in lectures in britain and denmark shortly before and after the war started, but he did not believe that it was technically feasible to extract a sufficient quantity of uranium-235. in september 1941, heisenberg, who had become head of the german nuclear energy project, visited bohr in copenhagen. during this meeting the two men took a private moment outside, the content of which has caused much speculation, as both gave differing accounts.
according to heisenberg, he began to address nuclear energy, morality and the war, to which bohr seems to have reacted by terminating the conversation abruptly while not giving heisenberg hints about his own opinions. ivan supek, one of heisenberg's students and friends, claimed that the main subject of the meeting was carl friedrich von weizsã¤cker, who had proposed trying to persuade bohr to mediate peace between britain and germany.

in 1957, heisenberg wrote to robert jungk, who was then working on the book """". heisenberg explained that he had visited copenhagen to communicate to bohr the views of several german scientists, that production of a nuclear weapon was possible with great efforts, and this raised enormous responsibilities on the world's scientists on both sides. when bohr saw jungk's depiction in the danish translation of the book, he drafted (but never sent) a letter to heisenberg, stating that he never understood the purpose of heisenberg's visit, was shocked by heisenberg's opinion that germany would win the war, and that atomic weapons could be decisive.

michael frayn's 1998 play ""copenhagen"" explores what might have happened at the 1941 meeting between heisenberg and bohr. a bbc television film version of the play was first screened on 26 september 2002, with stephen rea as bohr, and daniel craig as heisenberg. the same meeting had previously been dramatised by the bbc's ""horizon"" science documentary series in 1992, with anthony bate as bohr, and philip anthony as heisenberg. the meeting is also dramatized in the norwegian/danish/british miniseries ""the heavy water war"".

in september 1943, word reached bohr and his brother harald that the nazis considered their family to be jewish, since their mother was jewish, and that they were therefore in danger of being arrested. the danish resistance helped bohr and his wife escape by sea to sweden on 29 september. the next day, bohr persuaded king gustaf v of sweden to make public sweden's willingness to provide asylum to jewish refugees. on 2 october 1943, swedish radio broadcast that sweden was ready to offer asylum, and the mass rescue of the danish jews by their countrymen followed swiftly thereafter. some historians claim that bohr's actions led directly to the mass rescue, while others say that, though bohr did all that he could for his countrymen, his actions were not a decisive influence on the wider events. eventually, over 7,000 danish jews escaped to sweden.
when the news of bohr's escape reached britain, lord cherwell sent a telegram to bohr asking him to come to britain. bohr arrived in scotland on 6 october in a de havilland mosquito operated by the british overseas airways corporation (boac). the mosquitos were unarmed high-speed bomber aircraft that had been converted to carry small, valuable cargoes or important passengers. by flying at high speed and high altitude, they could cross german-occupied norway, and yet avoid german fighters. bohr, equipped with parachute, flying suit and oxygen mask, spent the three-hour flight lying on a mattress in the aircraft's bomb bay. during the flight, bohr did not wear his flying helmet as it was too small, and consequently did not hear the pilot's intercom instruction to turn on his oxygen supply when the aircraft climbed to high altitude to overfly norway. he passed out from oxygen starvation and only revived when the aircraft descended to lower altitude over the north sea. bohr's son aage followed his father to britain on another flight a week later, and became his personal assistant.

bohr was warmly received by james chadwick and sir john anderson, but for security reasons bohr was kept out of sight. he was given an apartment at st james's palace and an office with the british tube alloys nuclear weapons development team. bohr was astonished at the amount of progress that had been made. chadwick arranged for bohr to visit the united states as a tube alloys consultant, with aage as his assistant. on 8 december 1943, bohr arrived in washington, d.c., where he met with the director of the manhattan project, brigadier general leslie r. groves, jr. he visited einstein and pauli at the institute for advanced study in princeton, new jersey, and went to los alamos in new mexico, where the nuclear weapons were being designed. for security reasons, he went under the name of ""nicholas baker"" in the united states, while aage became ""james baker"". in may 1944 the danish resistance newspaper de frie danske reported that they had learned that 'the famous son of denmark professor niels bohr' in october the previous year had fled his country via sweden to london and from there travelled to moscow from where he could be assumed to support the war effort.

bohr did not remain at los alamos, but paid a series of extended visits over the course of the next two years. robert oppenheimer credited bohr with acting ""as a scientific father figure to the younger men"", most notably richard feynman. bohr is quoted as saying, ""they didn't need my help in making the atom bomb."" oppenheimer gave bohr credit for an important contribution to the work on modulated neutron initiators. ""this device remained a stubborn puzzle,"" oppenheimer noted, ""but in early february 1945 niels bohr clarified what had to be done.""

bohr recognised early that nuclear weapons would change international relations. in april 1944, he received a letter from peter kapitza, written some months before when bohr was in sweden, inviting him to come to the soviet union. the letter convinced bohr that the soviets were aware of the anglo-american project, and would strive to catch up. he sent kapitza a non-committal response, which he showed to the authorities in britain before posting. bohr met churchill on 16 may 1944, but found that ""we did not speak the same language"". churchill disagreed with the idea of openness towards the russians to the point that he wrote in a letter: ""it seems to me bohr ought to be confined or at any rate made to see that he is very near the edge of mortal crimes.""

oppenheimer suggested that bohr visit president franklin d. roosevelt to convince him that the manhattan project should be shared with the soviets in the hope of speeding up its results. bohr's friend, supreme court justice felix frankfurter, informed president roosevelt about bohr's opinions, and a meeting between them took place on 26 august 1944. roosevelt suggested that bohr return to the united kingdom to try to win british approval. when churchill and roosevelt met at hyde park on 19 september 1944, they rejected the idea of informing the world about the project, and the aide-mã©moire of their conversation contained a rider that ""enquiries should be made regarding the activities of professor bohr and steps taken to ensure that he is responsible for no leakage of information, particularly to the russians"".

in june 1950, bohr addressed an ""open letter"" to the united nations calling for international cooperation on nuclear energy. in the 1950s, after the soviet union's first nuclear weapon test, the international atomic energy agency was created along the lines of bohr's suggestion. in 1957 he received the first ever atoms for peace award.

with the war now ended, bohr returned to copenhagen on 25 august 1945, and was re-elected president of the royal danish academy of arts and sciences on 21 september. at a memorial meeting of the academy on 17 october 1947 for king christian x, who had died in april, the new king, frederick ix, announced that he was conferring the order of the elephant on bohr. this award was normally awarded only to royalty and heads of state, but the king said that it honoured not just bohr personally, but danish science. bohr designed his own coat of arms which featured a taijitu (symbol of yin and yang) and a motto in , ""opposites are complementary"".

the second world war demonstrated that science, and physics in particular, now required considerable financial and material resources. to avoid a brain drain to the united states, twelve european countries banded together to create cern, a research organisation along the lines of the national laboratories in the united states, designed to undertake big science projects beyond the resources of any one of them alone. questions soon arose regarding the best location for the facilities. bohr and kramers felt that the institute in copenhagen would be the ideal site. pierre auger, who organised the preliminary discussions, disagreed; he felt that both bohr and his institute were past their prime, and that bohr's presence would overshadow others. after a long debate, bohr pledged his support to cern in february 1952, and geneva was chosen as the site in october. the cern theory group was based in copenhagen until their new accommodation in geneva was ready in 1957. victor weisskopf, who later became the director general of cern, summed up bohr's role, saying that ""there were other personalities who started and conceived the idea of cern. the enthusiasm and ideas of the other people would not have been enough, however, if a man of his stature had not supported it.""

meanwhile, scandinavian countries formed the nordic institute for theoretical physics in 1957, with bohr as its chairman. he was also involved with the founding of the research establishment risã¸ of the danish atomic energy commission, and served as its first chairman from february 1956.

bohr died of heart failure at his home in carlsberg on 18 november 1962. he was cremated, and his ashes were buried in the family plot in the assistens cemetery in the nã¸rrebro section of copenhagen, along with those of his parents, his brother harald, and his son christian. years later, his wife's ashes were also interred there. on 7 october 1965, on what would have been his 80th birthday, the institute for theoretical physics at the university of copenhagen was officially renamed to what it had been called unofficially for many years: the niels bohr institute.

bohr received numerous honours and accolades. in addition to the nobel prize, he received the hughes medal in 1921, the matteucci medal in 1923, the franklin medal in 1926, the copley medal in 1938, the order of the elephant in 1947, the atoms for peace award in 1957 and the sonning prize in 1961. he became foreign member of the royal netherlands academy of arts and sciences in 1923, and of the royal society in 1926. the bohr model's semicentennial was commemorated in denmark on 21 november 1963 with a postage stamp depicting bohr, the hydrogen atom and the formula for the difference of any two hydrogen energy levels: formula_3. several other countries have also issued postage stamps depicting bohr. in 1997, the danish national bank began circulating the 500-krone banknote with the portrait of bohr smoking a pipe. an asteroid, 3948 bohr, was named after him, as was the bohr lunar crater and bohrium, the chemical element with atomic number 107.
"
elon musk,"
elon reeve musk (; born june 28, 1971) is a technology entrepreneur, investor, and engineer. he holds south african, canadian, and u.s. citizenship and is the founder, ceo, and chief engineer/designer of spacex; co-founder, ceo, and product architect of tesla, inc.; co-founder of neuralink; founder of the boring company; co-founder and initial co-chairman of openai; and co-founder of paypal. in december 2016, he was ranked 21st on the ""forbes"" list of the world's most powerful people. he has a net worth of $19.4 billion and is listed by ""forbes"" as the 40th-richest person in the world.

born and raised in pretoria, south africa, musk moved to canada when he was 17 to attend queen's university. he transferred to the university of pennsylvania two years later, where he received a bachelor's degree in economics from the wharton school and a bachelor's degree in physics from the college of arts and sciences. he began a ph.d. in applied physics and material sciences at stanford university in 1995 but dropped out after two days to pursue an entrepreneurial career. he subsequently co-founded zip2, a web software company, which was acquired by compaq for $340 million in 1999. musk then founded x.com, an online bank. it merged with confinity in 2000 and later that year became paypal, which was bought by ebay for $1.5 billion in october 2002.

in may 2002, musk founded spacex, an aerospace manufacturer and space transport services company, of which he is ceo and lead designer. he joined tesla, inc., an electric vehicle manufacturer, in 2004, the year after it was founded, and became its ceo and product architect. in 2006, he inspired the creation of solarcity, a solar energy services company (now a subsidiary of tesla) and operated as its chairman. in 2015, musk co-founded openai, a nonprofit research company that aims to promote friendly artificial intelligence. in july 2016, he co-founded neuralink, a neurotechnology company focused on developing brainâcomputer interfaces. in december 2016, musk founded the boring company, an infrastructure and tunnel-construction company.

in addition to his primary business pursuits, musk has envisioned a high-speed transportation system known as the hyperloop, and has proposed a vertical take-off and landing supersonic jet electric aircraft with electric fan propulsion, known as the musk electric jet. musk has stated that the goals of spacex, tesla, and solarcity revolve around his vision to change the world and humanity. his goals include reducing global warming through sustainable energy production and consumption, and reducing the risk of human extinction by establishing a human colony on mars.

musk was born on june 28, 1971, in pretoria, transvaal, south africa, the son of maye musk (), a model and dietitian from regina, saskatchewan, canada, and errol musk, a south african electromechanical engineer, pilot, and sailor. he has a younger brother, kimbal (born 1972), and a younger sister, tosca (born 1974). his maternal grandfather, dr. joshua haldeman, was an american-born canadian. his paternal grandmother was british, and he also has pennsylvania dutch ancestry. after his parents divorced in 1980, musk lived mostly with his father in the suburbs of pretoria, which musk chose two years after his parents split up, but now musk says it was a mistake. as an adult, musk has severed relations with his father, whom he has referred to as ""a terrible human being"". he has a half-sister and a half-brother.

during his childhood, musk was an avid reader. at the age of 10, he developed an interest in computing with the commodore vic-20. he taught himself computer programming at the age of 10, and by the age of 12 sold the code of a basic-based video game he created called ""blastar"", to a magazine called ""pc and office technology"", for approximately $500. a web version of the game is available online.
his childhood reading included isaac asimov's ""foundation"" series, from which he drew the lesson that ""you should try to take the set of actions that are likely to prolong civilization, minimize the probability of a dark age and reduce the length of a dark age if there is one"".

musk was severely bullied throughout his childhood and was once hospitalized when a group of boys threw him down a flight of stairs and then smashed his head into the pavement until he lost consciousness. he later revealed that he had to get a nose job to repair the damage.

musk attended waterkloof house preparatory school and bryanston high school before graduating from pretoria boys high school. although musk's father insisted that elon go to college in pretoria, musk became determined to move to the united states. as he states, ""i remember thinking and seeing that america is where great things are possible, more than any other country in the world."" knowing it would be easy to get to the united states from canada, he moved to canada against his father's wishes in june 1989, just before his 18thbirthday, after obtaining a canadian passport through his canadian-born mother.

at the age of 17, in 1989, musk moved to canada to attend queen's university, avoiding mandatory service in the south african military. he left in 1992 to study business and physics at the university of pennsylvania; he graduated with an undergraduate degree in economics and stayed for a second bachelor's degree in physics.

after leaving penn, musk headed to stanford university in california to pursue a phd in energy physics. however, his move coincided with the internet boom, and he dropped out of stanford after just two days to become a part of it, launching his first company, zip2 corporation.

in 1995, musk and his brother, kimbal, started zip2, a web software company, with money raised from a small group of angel investors.
the company developed and marketed an internet city guide for the newspaper publishing industry. musk obtained contracts with ""the new york times"" and the ""chicago tribune"" and persuaded the board of directors to abandon plans for a merger with citysearch. while at zip2, musk wanted to become ceo; however, none of the board members would allow it. compaq acquired zip2 for in cash and in stock options in february 1999. musk received for his 7 percent share from the sale.

in march 1999, musk co-founded x.com, an online financial services and e-mail payment company, with from the sale of zip2. one year later, the company merged with confinity, which had a money-transfer service called paypal. the merged company focused on the paypal service and was renamed paypal in 2001. paypal's early growth was driven mainly by a viral marketing campaign where new customers were recruited when they received money through the service. musk was ousted in october 2000 from his role as ceo (although he remained on the board) due to disagreements with other company leadership, notably over his desire to move paypal's unix-based infrastructure to microsoft windows. in october 2002, paypal was acquired by ebay for in stock, of which musk received . before its sale, musk, who was the company's largest shareholder, owned 11.7% of paypal's shares.

in july 2017, musk purchased the domain x.com from paypal for an undisclosed amount, stating that it has sentimental value to him.

in 2001, musk conceived mars oasis, a project to land a miniature experimental greenhouse on mars, containing food crops growing on martian regolith, in an attempt to regain public interest in space exploration. in october 2001, musk travelled to moscow with jim cantrell (an aerospace supplies fixer), and adeo ressi (his best friend from college), to buy refurbished dnepr intercontinental ballistic missiles (icbms) that could send the envisioned payloads into space. the group met with companies such as npo lavochkin and kosmotras; however, according to cantrell, musk was seen as a novice and was consequently spat on by one of the russian chief designers, and the group returned to the united states empty-handed. in february 2002, the group returned to russia to look for three icbms, bringing along mike griffin. griffin had worked for the cia's venture capital arm, in-q-tel, as well as nasa's jet propulsion laboratory, and was just leaving orbital sciences, a maker of satellites and spacecraft. the group met again with kosmotras, and were offered one rocket for ; however, this was seen by musk as too expensive; musk consequently stormed out of the meeting. on the flight back from moscow, musk realized that he could start a company that could build the affordable rockets he needed. according to early tesla and spacex investor steve jurvetson, musk calculated that the raw materials for building a rocket actually were only 3 percent of the sales price of a rocket at the time. it was concluded that theoretically, by applying vertical integration and the modular approach from software engineering, spacex could cut launch price by a factor of ten and still enjoy a 70-percent gross margin. ultimately, musk ended up founding spacex with the long-term goal of creating a true spacefaring civilization.
with of his early fortune, musk founded space exploration technologies, or spacex, in may 2002. musk is chief executive officer (ceo) and chief technology officer (cto) of the hawthorne, california-based company. by 2016, musk's private trust holds 54% of spacex stock, equivalent to 78% of voting shares.

spacex develops and manufactures space launch vehicles with a focus on advancing the state of rocket technology. the company's first two launch vehicles are the falcon 1 and falcon 9 rockets (a nod to star wars' ""millennium falcon""), and its first spacecraft is the dragon (a nod to ""puff the magic dragon""). in seven years, spacex designed the family of falcon launch vehicles and the dragon multipurpose spacecraft. in september 2008, spacex's falcon 1 rocket became the first privately funded liquid-fueled vehicle to put a satellite into earth orbit. on may 25, 2012, the spacex dragon vehicle berthed with the iss, making history as the first commercial company to launch and berth a vehicle to the international space station.
in 2006, spacex was awarded a contract from nasa to continue the development and test of the spacex falcon 9 launch vehicle and dragon spacecraft in order to transport cargo to the international space station, followed by a nasa commercial resupply services program contract on december 23, 2008, for 12 flights of its falcon 9 rocket and dragon spacecraft to the space station, replacing the us space shuttle after it retired in 2011. astronaut transport to the iss is currently handled solely by the soyuz, but spacex is one of two companies awarded a contract by nasa as part of the commercial crew development program, which is intended to develop a us astronaut transport capability by 2018.

musk believed that the key to making space travel affordable is to make rockets reusable, though most experts in the space industry did not believe that reusable rockets were possible or feasible. on december 22, 2015, spacex successfully landed the first stage of its falcon rocket back at the launch pad. this was the first time in history such a feat had been achieved by an orbital rocket and was a significant step towards rocket reusability lowering the costs of access to space. this first stage recovery was replicated several times in 2016 by landing on an autonomous spaceport drone ship, an ocean-based recovery platform, and by the end of 2017, spacex had landed and recovered the first stage on 16 missions in a row where a landing and recovery were attempted, including all 14 attempts in 2017. 20 out of 42 first stage falcon 9 boosters have been recovered overall since the falcon 9 maiden flight in 2010.
in 2017 spacex launched 18 successful falcon 9 flights, more than doubling their highest previous year of 8.

on february 6, 2018, spacex successfully launched the falcon heavy, the fourth-highest capacity rocket ever built (after saturn v, energia and n1) and the most powerful rocket in operation . the inaugural mission carried a tesla roadster belonging to musk as a dummy payload.

spacex began development of the starlink constellation of low earth orbit satellites in 2015 to provide global internet coverage, with an initial 60 satellites launched on 24 may 2019.

spacex is both the largest private producer of rocket engines in the world and holder of the record for the highest thrust-to-weight ratio for a rocket engine (the merlin 1d). spacex has produced more than 100 operational merlin 1d engines. each merlin 1d engine can vertically lift the weight of 40 average family cars. in combination, the 9 merlin engines in the falcon 9 first stage produce anywhere from 5.8 to 6.7â mn (1.3 to 1.5â million pounds) of thrust, depending on altitude.

musk was influenced by isaac asimov's ""foundation"" series and views space exploration as an important step in preserving and expanding the consciousness of human life. musk said that multiplanetary life may serve as a hedge against threats to the survival of the human species.

an asteroid or a super volcano could destroy us, and we face risks the dinosaurs never saw: an engineered virus, inadvertent creation of a micro black hole, catastrophic global warming or some as-yet-unknown technology could spell the end of us. humankind evolved over millions of years, but in the last sixty years atomic weaponry created the potential to extinguish ourselves. sooner or later, we must expand life beyond this green and blue ballâor go extinct.
musk's goal is to reduce the cost of human spaceflight by a factor of 10. in a 2011 interview, he said he hopes to send humans to mars' surface within 10â20 years. in ashlee vance's , musk stated that he wants to establish a mars colony by 2040, with a population of 80,000. musk stated that, since mars' atmosphere lacks oxygen, all transportation would have to be electric (electric cars, electric trains, hyperloop, electric aircraft). musk stated in june 2016 that the first uncrewed flight of the larger interplanetary spaceship was aimed for departure to the red planet in 2022, to be followed by the first crewed its mars flight departing in 2024. in september 2016, musk revealed details of his architecture to explore and colonize mars. 

in late 2017, spacex unveiled the design for its next-generation launch vehicle and spacecraft systemâbfr (later renamed to starship)âthat would support all spacex launch service provider capabilities with a single set of very large vehicles: earth-orbit, lunar-orbit, interplanetary missions, and even intercontinental passenger transport on earth, and totally replace the falcon 9, falcon heavy and dragon vehicles in the 2020s. starship will have a core diameter. significant development on the vehicles began in 2017, with an initial prototype unveiled in september 2019, while the new rocket engine (raptor) development began in 2012, with a first test flight performed in august 2019.

tesla, inc. (originally tesla motors) was incorporated in july 2003 by martin eberhard and marc tarpenning, who financed the company until the series a round of funding.
both men played active roles in the company's early development prior to elon musk's involvement. musk led the series a round of investment in february 2004, joining tesla's board of directors as its chairman. musk took an active role within the company and oversaw roadster product design at a detailed level, but was not deeply involved in day-to-day business operations.
following the financial crisis in 2008 and after a series of escalating conflicts in 2007, eberhard was ousted from the firm. musk assumed leadership of the company as ceo and product architect in 2008, positions he still holds today. indeed, as of 2019, elon musk is the longest tenured ceo of any automotive manufacturer globally.

tesla motors first built an electric sports car, the tesla roadster, in 2008, with sales of about 2,500 vehicles to 31 countries. tesla began delivery of its four-door modelâ s sedan on june 22, 2012. it unveiled its third product, the model x, aimed at the suv/minivan market, on february 9, 2012; however, the model x launch was delayed until september 2015. in addition to its own cars, tesla sold electric powertrain systems to daimler for the smart ev, mercedes b-class electric drive and mercedes a class, and to toyota for the rav4 ev. musk was able to bring in both companies as long-term investors in tesla.

musk favored building a more affordable tesla model and building and selling electric vehicle powertrain components so that other automakers could produce electric vehicles at affordable prices without having to develop the products in-house; this led to the model 3 that was unveiled in 2016, with a planned base price of . several mainstream publications have compared him with henry ford for his work on advanced vehicle powertrains.

in a may 2013 interview with all things digital, musk said that to overcome the range limitations of electric cars, tesla planned to expand its network of supercharger stations, tripling the number on the east and west coasts of the u.s. that june, with plans for more expansion across north america, including canada, throughout the year.

in 2014, musk announced that tesla would allow its technology patents to be used by anyone in good faith in a bid to entice automobile manufacturers to speed up development of electric cars. ""the unfortunate reality is electric car programs (or programs for any vehicle that doesn't burn hydrocarbons) at the major manufacturers are small to non-existent, constituting an average of far less than 1% of their total vehicle sales,"" musk said.

in february 2016, musk announced that he had acquired the tesla.com domain name from stu grossman, who had owned it since 1992, and changed tesla's homepage to that domain.

, musk owned about 28.9â million tesla shares, which equates to about 22% of the company.
, musk's annual salary is one dollar, similar to that of steve jobs and other ceos; the remainder of his compensation is in the form of stock and performance-based bonuses.
in january 2018, musk was granted an option to buy up to 20.3 million shares if tesla's market value were to rise to $650 billion. majority shareholder approval was approved in march 2018. the grant was also meant to end speculation about musk's potential departure from tesla to devote more time to his other business ventures. a report by advisory firm glass lewis & co. to its clients argued against granting the options.
in september 2018, musk was charged by the u.s. securities and exchange commission for a tweet claiming that funding had been secured for taking tesla private. the lawsuit characterized the tweet as false, misleading, and damaging to investors, and sought to bar musk from serving as ceo on publicly traded companies. two days later, musk reached a settlement with the sec. as a result, musk and tesla were fined $20 million each, and musk was forced to step down as tesla chairman while remaining tesla's ceo. musk also proclaimed in several interviews since that he does not regret sending the tweet that triggered the sec investigation. according to reuters, musk said the tweet was ""worth it"".

according to abc news, ""as recently as oct. 4 2018, musk issued a sarcastic tweet, describing the agency [sec] as the 'shortseller enrichment commission,' despite having agreed to settlement terms a week earlier that his company, tesla, would monitor his tweets and other communications."" 
in a december 2018 interview with cbs's â60 minutesâ, musk mentioned that since reaching an agreement with sec, none of his tweets have been censored. he further mentioned that he has no respect for the sec by saying, ""i want to be clear. i do not respect the sec.""
on february 19, 2019, according to forbes, musk stated in a tweet that tesla would build half a million cars in 2019.
the sec reacted to musk's tweet by filing in court, initially asking the court to hold him in contempt for violating the terms of settlement agreement with such a tweet, which was disputed by musk. this was eventually settled by a joint agreement between musk and the sec clarifying the previous agreement details.

in january 2019, musk traveled to china for the groundbreaking of tesla's shanghai gigafactory, which is the company's first large-scale plant outside the u.s. part of his visit to china, musk also met the chinese premier li keqiang. during their exchange, musk expressed his admiration for china and wished he could visit china more often, to which the chinese premier was quoted as saying ""we can issue you a chinese green card if that helps.""

musk provided the initial concept and financial capital for solarcity, which was then co-founded in 2006 by his cousins lyndon and peter rive. by 2013, solarcity was the second largest provider of solar power systems in the united states. solarcity was acquired by tesla, inc. in 2016 and is currently a wholly owned subsidiary of tesla.

the underlying motivation for funding both solarcity and tesla was to help combat global warming. in 2012, musk announced that solarcity and tesla would collaborate to use electric vehicle batteries to smooth the impact of rooftop solar on the power grid, with the program going live in 2013.

on june 17, 2014, musk committed to building a solarcity advanced production facility in buffalo, new york, that would triple the size of the largest solar plant in the united states. musk stated the plant will be ""one of the single largest solar panel production plants in the world,"" and it will be followed by one or more even bigger facilities in subsequent years. the tesla gigafactory 2 is a photovoltaic (pv) cell factory, leased by tesla subsidiary solarcity in buffalo, new york. construction on the factory started in 2014 and was completed in 2017. tesla accepted $750 million in public funds from new york governor andrew cuomo as part of the buffalo billion project- a plan to invest money to help the economy of the buffalo, new york area- to build the factory and infrastructure.

on august 12, 2013, musk unveiled a concept for a high-speed transportation system incorporating reduced-pressure tubes in which pressurized capsules ride on an air cushion driven by linear induction motors and air compressors. the mechanism for releasing the concept was an alpha-design document that, in addition to scoping out the technology, outlined a notional route where such a transport system might be built: between the greater los angeles area and the san francisco bay area.

after earlier envisioning hyperloop, musk assigned a dozen engineers from tesla and spacex who worked for nine months, establishing the conceptual foundations and creating the designs for the transportation system. an early design for the system was then published in a whitepaper posted to the tesla and spacex blogs. musk's proposal, if technologically feasible at the costs he has cited, would make hyperloop travel cheaper than any other mode of transport for such long distances. the alpha design was proposed to use a partial vacuum to reduce aerodynamic drag, which it is theorized would allow for high-speed travel with relatively low power, with certain other features like air-bearing skis and an inlet compressor to reduce freestream flow. the document of alpha design estimated the total cost of an la-to-sf hyperloop system at , but this amount is speculative.

in june 2015, musk announced a design competition for students and others to build hyperloop pods to operate on a spacex-sponsored mile-long track in a 2015â2017 hyperloop pod competition. the track was used in january 2017, and musk also started building a tunnel.

hyperloop one, a company unaffiliated with musk, had announced that it had done its first successful test run on its devloop track in nevada on july 13, 2017. it was on may 12, 2017, at 12:02â a.m. and had lasted 5.3 seconds, reaching a top speed of 70â mph.

on july 20, 2017, elon musk announced that he had received verbal government approval to build a hyperloop from new york city to washington, d.c., stopping in both philadelphia and baltimore. however, the new york city transit authority, southeastern pennsylvania transportation authority, washington metropolitan area transit authority, maryland transit administration, united states department of homeland security, as well as the mayors of new york, philadelphia, baltimore, and washington, d.c. stated that they are unaware of any such agreement.

in december 2015, musk announced the creation of openai, a not-for-profit artificial intelligence (ai) research company. openai aims to develop artificial general intelligence in a way that is safe and beneficial to humanity.

by making ai available to everyone, openai wants to ""counteract large corporations who may gain too much power by owning super-intelligence systems devoted to profits, as well as governments which may use ai to gain power and even oppress their citizenry."" musk has stated he wants to counteract the concentration of power. in 2018 musk left the openai board to avoid possible future conflicts with his role as ceo of tesla as tesla increasingly becomes involved in ai.

however, in an interview with joe rogan in september 2018, musk warned about the dangers of developing artificial intelligence indiscriminately. in january 2019 mark harris of ""the guardian"" noted that on 23 january the musk foundation ""added a line to its website, stating its support for the âdevelopment of safe artificial intelligence to benefit humanityâ"".

in 2016, musk co-founded neuralink, a neurotechnology startup company to integrate the human brain with artificial intelligence. the company is centered on creating devices that can be implanted in the human brain, with the eventual purpose of helping human beings merge with software and keep pace with advancements in artificial intelligence. these enhancements could improve memory or allow more direct interfacing with computing devices.
musk sees neuralink and openai as related: ""openai is a nonprofit dedicated to minimizing the dangers of artificial intelligence, while neuralink is working on ways to implant technology into our brains to create mind-computer interfaces.""

on december 17, 2016, while stuck in traffic, musk tweeted ""[i] am going to build a tunnel boring machine and just start digging..."" the company was named 'the boring company'. on january 21, 2017, musk tweeted ""exciting progress on the tunnel front. plan to start digging in a month or so."" the first tunnel will start on the spacex campus, the boring test tunnel runs underneath west 120th street. , discussions with regulatory bodies had begun.

in february 2017, the company began digging a wide, long, and deep ""test trench"" on the premises of space x's offices in los angeles, since the construction requires no permits. musk had said in early 2017 that a 10-fold decrease in tunnel boring cost per mile is necessary for economic feasibility of the proposed tunnel network.
by late 2018, tbc had active construction, approved plans in place, or an operational tunnel in several areas of the united states: baltimore,
chicago and los angeles. tbc provided an update on the state of their technology and product line when they opened to the public their first mile-long test tunnel in hawthorne, california, on 18 december 2018, stating that it has been a proof-of-concept for the technology.
design is complete for the third-generation boring tbm, ""prufrock"", slated to support a 15x improvement in tunneling speed over the existing state of the art, and the machine will be assembled and begin engineering testing in 2019.

after a string of negative press targeting tesla caused musk to become frustrated, specifically articles published by reveal news criticizing tesla for its factory safety procedures, musk announced on twitter that he is planning on creating a website where users could rate the truthfulness of specific articles in addition to the credibility of journalists and publications. he suggested calling it ""pravda"" after a soviet union-era communist party newspaper of the same name.

this caused backlash from many journalists, claiming that a platform where any user could freely vote on an article's or a journalist's credibility could be prone to abuse.

after realizing the site ""pravda.com"" is used by the ukrainian internet newspaper ukrayinska pravda, musk bought the site pravduh.com on may 25, 2018.

in july 2018, musk attempted to provide assistance to rescuers during the tham luang cave rescue by ordering his employees to build a small rescue pod.

musk, responding to requests for help from twitter users, contacted james yenbamroong, ceo of thailand-based satellite company mu space, to get him connected with the thai government. he then ordered engineers from two of his companies to design a child-sized submarine to help the rescue effort and publicised the process via twitter. richard stanton, leader of the international rescue diving team, also urged musk to continue construction of the mini-submarine as a back-up, in case flooding worsened. engineers at musk's companies spacex and the boring company built the mini-submarine out of a falcon 9 liquid oxygen transfer tube and personally delivered it to thailand.

named ""wild boar"" after the children's soccer team, its design, a -long, -inch wide sealed tube weighing about propelled manually by divers in the front and back, was intended to solve the problem of safely transporting the children, who might have had difficulty learning the scuba skills required to exit the cave on their own without panicking. in case the mini-submarine could not fit through the cave system, elon musk also requested wing inflatables, a california-based inflatable boat manufacturer, to build inflatable escape pods. the pods were designed, fabricated, and tested in one day before being flown to thailand.

by this time, eight of the twelve children had already been rescued (using scuba equipment under anaesthesia) and thai authorities decided not to use the submarine.

elon musk was later awarded a member of the order of the direkgunabhorn by the king of thailand on march 2019 for his and his team's contributions to the rescue mission.

the supervisor of the rescue operation narongsak osatanakorn stated that the submarine was ""technologically sophisticated, [but] it doesnât fit with our mission to go in the cave,â. a caver who had been exploring the cave for the past six years and who had originally advised a probable location of the trapped football team, vernon unsworth, said that musk's idea ""had absolutely no chance of working ... the submarine, i believe, was about five foot six long, rigid, so it wouldn't have gone round corners or round any obstacles. it wouldn't have made the first 50 metres into the cave from the dive start point.""
although the device could safely hold an occupant, there were concerns that its rigid body was only slightly smaller than the narrowest passages in the cave, making it risky to get it through the tighter turns.
as media coverage of the event grew, some were skeptical of musk's intentions, claiming the submarine was mainly built for publicity for tesla and musk, citing the apparent uselessness of the device.
vernon unsworth, a caver who played a major advisory role in the rescue, criticized the submarine as amounting to nothing more than a public relations effort with no chance of success, and that musk ""had no conception of what the cave passage was like"" and ""can stick his submarine where it hurts"". musk asserted on twitter that the device would have worked and referred to unsworth as ""pedo guy"" without offering any evidence or explanation, causing backlash against musk. he subsequently deleted the tweets, along with an earlier tweet in which he told another critic of the device, ""stay tuned jackass."" on 16 july, unsworth stated that he was considering legal action in relation to musk's comments.

after musk's tweets, tesla shares fell 4% as some investors worried about his erratic behavior. tesla investors subsequently demanded that musk apologize. two days later, musk issued an apology for his remarks, stating that ""the fault is mine and mine alone"" and ""my words were spoken in anger"".
on 28 august 2018, in response to criticism from a writer on twitter regarding how musk had handled the diver's criticism, musk circled back to the pedophilia accusation, tweeting, ""you don't think it's strange he hasn't sued me? he was offered free legal services."" the following day, a letter from l.â lin wood, the rescuer's attorney, dated 6 august, emerged, showing that he had been making preparations for a libel lawsuit.

at some point, a self-proclaimed private investigator emailed musk with an offer to ""dig deep"" into unsworth's past, which musk accepted in august 2018; the investigator was later revealed to be a convicted felon with multiple counts of fraud. on 30 august, using details produced during the alleged investigation, musk sent a ""buzzfeed news"" reporter who had written about the controversy an email prefaced ""off the record"". it claimed that unsworth is a ""single white guy from england who's been traveling to or living in thailand for 30 to 40 years ... until moving to chiang rai for a child bride who was about 12 years old at the time"" (later stated by unsworth's wife to be false). on 5 september, the reporter tweeted a screenshot of the email, saying that ""off the record is a two-party agreement,"" which he ""did not agree to"".

in mid-september, unsworth filed a defamation suit in los angeles federal court, with plans to file a similar case in the united kingdom. the lawsuit contends that ""musk embarked on a pr campaign to destroy mr. unsworth's reputation by publishing false and heinous accusations of criminality against him to the public,"" and seeks upwards of in damages. in may 2019, it was announced that the defamation case would go to trial on 22 october 2019. in his defense, musk has argued that ""'pedo guy' was a common insult used in south africa when i was growing up ... synonymous with 'creepy old man' and is used to insult a person's appearance and demeanor."" judge stephen v. wilson rejected musk's claim that he was not making a real accusationâin part because of the email musk sent to buzzfeed.

musk first mentioned teslaquila in an april fools tweet in 2018. the proposed tesla-branded tequila appeared to become closer to reality in october 2018 as tesla filed an ""intent to use"" trademark application with the u.s. patent and trademark office. the trademark is for distilled agave liquor. musk reaffirmed his intention to release the product with a tweet, featuring a mockup of the bottle, on october 12.

mexico's tequila regulatory council (crt) has publicly denounced the proposed product, arguing, ""if it wants to make teslaquila viable as a tequila it would have to associate itself with an authorized tequila producer, comply with certain standards and request authorization from mexico's industrial property institute.""

on march 30, 2019, musk released a rap single to soundcloud under the username ""emo g records"". titled ""rip harambe"", the track was performed by yung jake, written by yung jake and caroline polachek, and produced by bloodpop. within ten days, the song had achieved more than 2,000,000 plays.

politically, musk has described himself as ""half democrat, half republican"" and ""i'm somewhere in the middle, socially liberal and fiscally conservative."" in 2018, he stated that he was ""not a conservative. i'm registered independent [and] politically moderate."" prompted by the emergence of self-driving cars and artificial intelligence, musk has voiced support for a universal basic income; he additionally backs direct democracy. he has described himself as a socialist, but ""not the kind that shifts resources from most productive to least productive, pretending to do good, while actually causing harm"" - arguing instead, ""true socialism seeks greatest good for all."" he supports targeting an inclusive tax rate of 40%, prefers consumption taxes to income taxes, and supports the estate tax, as the ""probability of progeny being equally excellent at capital allocation is not high.""

musk has described the united states as ""[inarguably] the greatest country that has ever existed on earth,"" describing it as ""the greatest force for good of any country that's ever been."" musk believes democracy would not exist any longer if not for the united states, saying that it prevented this disappearance on three occasions through its participation in world war i, world war ii and the cold war. musk also stated that he thinks ""it would be a mistake to say the united states is perfect, it certainly is not. there have been many foolish things the united states has done and bad things the united states has done.""

before the election of donald trump as president of the united states, musk criticized candidate trump by saying: ""i feel a bit stronger that he is probably not the right guy. he doesn't seem to have the sort of character that reflects well on the united states."" following donald trump's inauguration, musk expressed approval of trump's choice of rex tillerson as secretary of state and accepted an invitation to appear on a panel advising president trump. regarding his cooperation with trump, musk has subsequently commented: ""the more voices of reason that the president hears, the better."" he subsequently resigned from both in june 2017, in protest at trump's decision to withdraw the united states from the paris agreement on climate change.

in august 2019, musk came out on twitter in support of 2020 democratic presidential candidate andrew yang, whose platform revolves around the ongoing problem of job displacement through technological automation and artificial intelligence. musk said in a tweet that universal basic income, which yang supports, is ""obviously needed.""

in an interview with ""the washington post"", musk stated he was a ""significant (though not top-tier) donor to democrats,"" but that he also gives heavily to republicans. musk further stated that political contributions are a requirement in order to have a voice in the united states government.

a 2012 report from the sunlight foundation, a nonpartisan group that tracks government spending, found that since 2002, spacex had spent more on lobbying the united states congress and more than in political contributions to democrats and republicans. the same report said that ""spacex's campaign to win political support has been systematic and sophisticated,"" and that ""unlike most tech-startups, spacex has maintained a significant lobbying presence in washington almost since day1."" and that ""musk himself has donated roughly to various campaigns since 2002. in 2004, he contributed to president george w. bush's reelection campaign, maxing out (over ) to barack obama's reelection campaign and donated to republican sen. marco rubio, who represents florida, a state critical to the space industry. (...) all told, musk and spacex gave out roughly in the 2012 election cycle."" additionally, spacex hired former republican senate majority leader trent lott to represent the company, via the washington-based lobbying group patton boggs llp. alongside patton boggs llp, spacex uses several other outside lobbying firms, who work with spacex's own lobbyists.

musk had been a supporter of the u.s. political action committee (pac) fwd.us, which was started by fellow high-profile entrepreneur mark zuckerberg and advocates for immigration reform. however, in may 2013, musk publicly withdrew his support in protest of advertisements the pac was running that supported causes like the keystone pipeline. musk and other members, including david o. sacks, pulled out, criticizing the strategy as ""cynical."" musk further stated, ""we shouldn't give in to the politics. if we give in to that, we'll get the political system we deserve.""

in december 2013, sean becker of the media/political website mic called musk a ""complete hypocrite,"" stating that ""[for] the 2014 election cycle, musk has contributed to the longhorn pac and the national republican congressional committee â both of which have funded the campaigns of anti-science, anti-environment candidates such as rep. michelle bachman (r-minn.)."" musk has directly contributed to republican sen. marco rubio, who has been accused of holding similar positions regarding climate change.

musk has stated that he does not believe the u.s. government should provide subsidies to companies but should instead use a carbon tax to price in the negative externality of air pollution and discourage poor behavior. musk says that the free market would achieve the best solution, and that producing environmentally unfriendly vehicles should come with its own consequences.

musk's statements have been widely criticized, with stanford university professor fred turner noting that ""if you're an entrepreneur like elon musk, you will take the money where you can get it, but at the same time believe as a matter of faith that it's entrepreneurship and technology that are the sources of social change, not the state. it is not quite self-delusion, but there is a habit of thinking of oneself as a free-standing, independent agent, and of not acknowledging the subsidies that one received. and this goes on all the time in silicon valley."" author michael shellenberger argued that ""in the case of musk, it is hard not to read that as a kind of defensiveness. and i think there is a business reason for it. they are dealing with a lot of investors for whom subsidies are not the basis for a long-term viable business, and they often want to exaggerate the speed with which they are going to be able to become independent."" shellenberger continues, ""we would all be better off if these entrepreneurs were a bit more grateful, a bit more humble."" while journalist and author jim motavalli, who interviewed musk for ""high voltage"", his 2011 book about the electric vehicle industry, speculated that ""elon is now looking at it from the point of view of a winner, and he doesn't want to see other people win because they get government money â i do think there is a tendency of people, once they have succeeded, to want to pull the ladder up after them.""

in 2015, musk's statements were subject to further scrutiny when an ""la times"" article claimed that spacex, tesla, solarcity and buyers of their products had or were projected to receive together an estimated in government subsidies over twenty years. one example given is new york state, which is spending $750â million to build a solar panel factory in buffalo which will be leased to solarcity for $1 a year. the deal also includes no property taxes for a decade, an estimated $260â million valuation. musk employs a former u.s. state department official as the chief negotiator for tesla.

when asked whether he believed ""there was some kind of destiny involved"" in humanity's transition to a multi-planetary species, rather than ""just physics"", musk responded:
well, i do. do i think that there's some sort of master intelligence architecting all of this stuff? i think probably not because then you have to say: ""where does the master intelligence come from?"" so it sort of begs the question. so i think really you can explain this with the fundamental laws of physics. you know it's complex phenomenon from simple elements.

musk has stated that he does not pray, or worship any being, although he asked ""any entities that [were] listening"" to ""bless [the] launch"" before an important falcon 1 launch. when asked whether he thought science and religion could co-exist, musk replied ""probably not.""

although musk believes there could be simple life on other planets, he is unsure whether other intelligent life is likely. musk later said that he ""hope[s] that there is other intelligent life in the known universe"", and stated that it is ""probably more likely than not, but that's a complete guess.""

musk has also considered the simulation hypothesis as a potential solution to the fermi paradox:
the absence of any noticeable life may be an argument in favour of us being in a simulation ... like when you're playing an adventure game, and you can see the stars in the background, but you can't ever get there. if it's not a simulation, then maybe we're in a lab and there's some advanced alien civilization that's just watching how we develop, out of curiosity, like mould in a petri dish ... if you look at our current technology level, something strange has to happen to civilizations, and i mean strange in a bad way. ... and it could be that there are a whole lot of dead, one-planet civilizations.

musk has frequently spoken about the potential dangers of artificial intelligence, calling it ""the most serious threat to the survival of the human race"". during a 2014 interview at the mit aeroastro centennial symposium, musk described ai as humanity's largest existential threat, further stating, ""i'm increasingly inclined to think that there should be some regulatory oversight, maybe at the national and international level, just to make sure that we don't do something very foolish."" musk described the creation of artificial intelligence as ""summoning the demon"".

despite this, musk has previously invested in deepmind, an ai firm, and vicarious, a company working to improve machine intelligence. in january 2015, he donated $10â million to the future of life institute, an organization focused on challenges posed by advanced technologies. he was previously the co-chairman of openai, a nonprofit artificial intelligence research company.

musk has said that his investments are ""not from the standpoint of actually trying to make any investment return ... i like to just keep an eye on what's going on with artificial intelligence."" musk continued, ""there have been movies about this, you know, like ""terminator"" â there are some scary outcomes. and we should try to make sure the outcomes are good, not bad.""

in june 2016, musk was asked whether he thinks humans live in a computer simulation, to which he answered:

the strongest argument for us probably being in a simulation i think is the following: 40 years ago we had pong â two rectangles and a dot. that's where we were. now 40 years later we have photorealistic, 3d simulations with millions of people playing simultaneously and it's getting better every year. and soon we'll have virtual reality, we'll have augmented reality. if you assume any rate of improvement at all, then the games will become indistinguishable from reality, just indistinguishable.

musk's warnings about artificial intelligence have brought him some controversy. he and facebook founder mark zuckerberg have clashed, with the latter calling his warnings ""pretty irresponsible"". musk responded to zuckerberg's censure by saying that he had discussed ai with zuckerberg and found him to have only a limited understanding of the subject. in 2014, slate's adam elkus argued that current ais were as intelligent as a toddler, and only in certain fields, going on to say that musk's ""summoning the demon"" analogy may be harmful because it could result in significant cuts to ai research budgets.

the information technology and innovation foundation (itif), a washington d.c. think-tank, awarded its annual luddite award to ""alarmists touting an artificial intelligence apocalypse""; its president, robert d. atkinson, complained that musk and others say ai is the largest existential threat to humanity. atkinson stated ""that's not a very winning message if you want to get ai funding out of congress to the national science foundation."" ""nature"" sharply disagreed with the itif in an april 2016 editorial, siding instead with musk, and concluding: ""it is crucial that progress in technology is matched by solid, well-funded research to anticipate the scenarios it could bring about ... if that is a luddite perspective, then so be it."" in a 2015 ""washington post"" editorial, researcher murray shanahan stated that human-level ai is unlikely to arrive in the near future, but that nevertheless ""the time to start thinking through the consequences is now.""

at a tesla event on the sidelines of the conference on neural information processing systems in december 2017, musk stated that:

i think public transport is painful. it sucks. why do you want to get on something with a lot of other people, that doesn't leave where you want it to leave, doesn't start where you want it to start, doesn't end where you want it to end? and it doesn't go all the time. ... it's a pain in the ass. that's why everyone doesn't like it. and there's like a bunch of random strangers, one of who might be a serial killer, ok, great. and so that's why people like individualized transport, that goes where you want, when you want.

afterwards, he dismissed an audience member's response that public transportation functioned effectively in japan.

his comment sparked widespread criticism from both the public and transit experts. urban planning expert brent toderian started the hashtag #greatthingsthathappenedontransit which was widely adopted by twitter users in order to dispel musk's notion that everybody hated public transport. yonah freemark, an urbanist and journalist specialising in planning and transportation, summarised musk's views on public transport as ""it's terrible. you might be killed. japanese trains are awful. individualized transport for everyone! congestion? induced demand? climate change impacts? unwalkable streets? who cares!""

jarrett walker, a known public transport expert and consultant from portland, said that ""musk's hatred of sharing space with strangers is a luxury (or pathology) that only the rich can afford"", referring to the theory that planning a city around the preferencesâ of a minority yieldsâ an outcome that usually does not work for the majority. musk responded with ""you're an idiot"", later saying ""sorry ... meant to say 'sanctimonious idiot'."" the exchange received a significant amount of media attention and prompted nobel laureate paul krugman to comment on the controversy, saying that ""you're an idiot"" is ""elon musk's idea of a cogent argument"".

musk is chairman of the musk foundation, which focuses its philanthropic efforts on providing solar-power energy systems in disaster areas as well as other goals. in 2010, the musk foundation collaborated with solarcity to donate a 25-kw solar power system to the south bay community alliance's hurricane response center in coden, alabama. in july 2011, the musk foundation donated towards a solar power project in såma, japan, a city that had been recently devastated by a tsunami.

in july 2014, musk was asked by cartoonist matthew inman and william terbo, the grandnephew of nikola tesla, to donate toward the construction of the tesla science center at wardenclyffe. ultimately, musk agreed to donate toward the project and additionally pledged to build a tesla supercharger in the museum car park.

musk donated to the future of life institute in january 2015, to run a global research program aimed at keeping artificial intelligence beneficial to humanity.

musk began dating american actress amber heard in 2016 but the two split up after one year due to their conflicting schedules. on may 7, 2018, musk and canadian musician grimes revealed that they had begun dating; they are still together as of march 20, 2019.

in mid-september 2018, musk appeared on ""the joe rogan experience"" podcast and discussed various topics for over two hours. within five days, the appearance had accrued 10 million youtube views. one of the highest profile and controversial aspects of the program was musk's taking a puff from a cannabis-laced cigar offered by rogan. to rogan's enquiry on how often he smoked cannabis, musk replied: ""almost never. i know a lot of people like weed and that's fine, but i don't find that is very good for productivity... not for me.""
""the washington post"" observed, ""in the media's hands, it became a story about musk's growing instability..."" tesla stock dropped after the incident, which coincided with the confirmation of the departure of tesla's vice president of worldwide finance earlier that day. ""fortune"" wondered if the cannabis use could have ramifications for spacex contracts with the united states air force, though a usaf spokesperson told ""the verge"" that there was no investigation being carried out and that the air force is still processing the situation.
in an interview on ""60 minutes"", musk said of the pot-smoking incident: ""i do not smoke pot. as anybody who watched that podcast could tell, i have no idea how to smoke pot.""


in ""iron man 2"" (2010), musk met tony stark (robert downey jr.) in a restaurant, and had some brief lines regarding an ""idea for an electric jet."" in january 2015, musk made a guest appearance playing himself on ""the simpsons"" in an episode titled ""the musk who fell to earth""; the episode poked fun at many of musk's ideas.

in november 2015, musk appeared in an episode of ""the big bang theory"", playing himself, volunteering at a soup kitchen with wolowitz.

musk was featured in the 2015 environmental documentary ""racing extinction"", in which a custom tesla model s was designed to help project images of critically endangered species onto public buildings, including the empire state building and the vatican.

in 2016, musk appeared as himself in the romantic comedy film ""why him?"" where he was briefly met by one of the main characters, ned flemming played by bryan cranston, in a bar at a party. in december 2016, robby in new girl refers to saving a life, and when asked who, responds ""do you know who elon musk is?"". also in 2016, musk was referenced by dr. martin stein on the cw time-travel tv show ""dc's legends of tomorrow"". during time travel to the past, stein meets his younger self and introduced himself as elon musk, to disguise his own identity.

in october 2017, musk was mentioned as a historic pioneer on the cbs all access series """". set in the year 2256, captain gabriel lorca attempts to motivate a scientist on his ship by asking him ""how do you want to be remembered in history? alongside the wright brothers, elon musk, zefram cochrane? or as a failed fungus expert. a selfish little man who put the survival of his own ego before the lives of others?"" according to a techcrunch article published the day after the episode aired, this mention is ""also interesting because of its notable omission of amazon and blue origin founder jeff bezos: this other space entrepreneur is such a big fan of star trek that he pitched and succeeded in landing a cameo in ""star trek beyond"" as an alien being, but he doesn't rate a mention from lorca among the spaceflight pantheon.""

in november 2017, musk appeared as himself in season 1, episode 6 of ""the big bang theory"" spin-off prequel series ""young sheldon"". the successful first landing of a spacex falcon 9 first stage on a drone ship on april 8, 2016, is shown being covered by cnn. this is followed by a scene where musk is shown alone in his office reading the notebook that young sheldon mailed nasa in 1989 (a scene shown earlier in the episode) containing calculations detailing how this feat could be accomplished.

michael jordan,"
michael jeffrey jordan (born february 17, 1963), also known by his initials mj, is an american former professional basketball player and the principal owner of the charlotte hornets of the national basketball association (nba). he played 15 seasons in the nba, winning six championships with the chicago bulls. his biography on the official nba website states: ""by acclamation, michael jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time."" he was one of the most effectively marketed athletes of his generation and was considered instrumental in popularizing the nba around the world in the 1980s and 1990s.

jordan played three seasons for coach dean smith with the north carolina tar heels. as a freshman, he was a member of the tar heels' national championship team in 1982. jordan joined the bulls in 1984 as the third overall draft pick. he quickly emerged as a league star and entertained crowds with his prolific scoring. his leaping ability, demonstrated by performing slam dunks from the free throw line in slam dunk contests, earned him the nicknames air jordan and his airness. he also gained a reputation for being one of the best defensive players in basketball. in 1991, he won his first nba championship with the bulls, and followed that achievement with titles in 1992 and 1993, securing a ""three-peat"". although jordan abruptly retired from basketball before the beginning of the 1993â94 nba season, and started a new career in minor league baseball, he returned to the bulls in march 1995 and led them to three additional championships in 1996, 1997, and 1998, as well as a then-record 72 regular-season wins in the 1995â96 nba season. jordan retired for a second time in january 1999, but returned for two more nba seasons from 2001 to 2003 as a member of the washington wizards.

jordan's individual accolades and accomplishments include six nba finals most valuable player (mvp) awards, ten scoring titles (both all-time records), five mvp awards, ten all-nba first team designations, nine all-defensive first team honors, fourteen nba all-star game selections, three all-star game mvp awards, three steals titles, and the 1988 nba defensive player of the year award. he holds the nba records for highest career regular season scoring average (30.12 points per game) and highest career playoff scoring average (33.45 points per game). in 1999, he was named the greatest north american athlete of the 20th century by espn, and was second to babe ruth on the associated press' list of athletes of the century. jordan is a two-time inductee into the naismith memorial basketball hall of fame, having been enshrined in 2009 for his individual career, and again in 2010 as part of the group induction of the 1992 united states men's olympic basketball team (""the dream team""). he became a member of the fiba hall of fame in 2015.

jordan is also known for his product endorsements. he fueled the success of nike's air jordan sneakers, which were introduced in 1984 and remain popular today. jordan also starred as himself in the 1996 film ""space jam"". in 2006, he became part-owner and head of basketball operations for the charlotte bobcats (now hornets), and bought a controlling interest in 2010. in 2014, jordan became the first billionaire player in nba history. he is the third-richest african-american, behind robert f. smith and oprah winfrey.

jordan was born in new york city, new york, to deloris (nã©e peoples), who worked in banking, and james r. jordan sr., an equipment supervisor. his family moved to wilmington, north carolina, when he was a toddler.

jordan is the fourth of five children. he has two older brothers, larry jordan and james r. jordan, jr., one older sister, deloris, and one younger sister, roslyn. jordan's brother james retired in 2006 as the command sergeant major of the 35th signal brigade of the xviii airborne corps in the u.s. army.

jordan attended emsley a. laney high school in wilmington, where he highlighted his athletic career by playing basketball, baseball, and football. he tried out for the varsity basketball team during his sophomore year, but at 5'11"" (1.80 m), he was deemed too short to play at that level. his taller friend, harvest leroy smith, was the only sophomore to make the team.

motivated to prove his worth, jordan became the star of laney's junior varsity team, and tallied several 40-point games. the following summer, he grew four inches (10â cm) and trained rigorously. upon earning a spot on the varsity roster, jordan averaged more than 25 points per game (ppg) over his final two seasons of high school play. as a senior, he was selected to play in the 1981 mcdonald's all-american game and scored 30 points, after averaging 27 points, 12 rebounds and 6 assists per game for the season.

jordan was recruited by numerous college basketball programs, including duke, north carolina, south carolina, syracuse, and virginia. in 1981, jordan accepted a basketball scholarship to the university of north carolina at chapel hill, where he majored in cultural geography.

as a freshman in coach dean smith's team-oriented system, he was named acc freshman of the year after he averaged 13.4 ppg on 53.4% shooting (field goal percentage). he made the game-winning jump shot in the 1982 ncaa championship game against georgetown, which was led by future nba rival patrick ewing. jordan later described this shot as the major turning point in his basketball career. during his three seasons with the tar heels, he averaged 17.7 ppg on 54.0% shooting, and added 5.0 rpg. he was selected by consensus to the ncaa all-american first team in both his sophomore (1983) and junior (1984) seasons. after winning the naismith and the wooden college player of the year awards in 1984, jordan left north carolina one year before his scheduled graduation to enter the 1984 nba draft. the chicago bulls selected jordan with the third overall pick, after hakeem olajuwon (houston rockets) and sam bowie (portland trail blazers). one of the primary reasons why jordan was not drafted sooner was because the first two teams were in need of a center. however, trail blazers general manager stu inman contended that it was not a matter of drafting a center, but more a matter of taking sam bowie over jordan, in part because portland already had clyde drexler, who was a guard with similar skills to jordan. espn, citing bowie's injury-laden college career, named the blazers' choice of bowie as the worst draft pick in north american professional sports history. jordan returned to north carolina to complete his degree in 1986. he graduated the same year with a bachelor of arts degree in geography. during his tenure at unc, jordan pledged and joined omega psi phi fraternity.

during his rookie season with the bulls, jordan averaged 28.2 ppg on 51.5% shooting, and helped make a team that had won 35% of games in the previous three seasons playoff contenders. he quickly became a fan favorite even in opposing arenas, roy s. johnson of ""the new york times"" described him as ""the phenomenal rookie of the bulls"" in november, and jordan appeared on the cover of ""sports illustrated"" with the heading ""a star is born"" in december. the fans also voted in jordan as an all-star starter during his rookie season. controversy arose before the all-star game when word surfaced that several veteran playersâled by isiah thomasâwere upset by the amount of attention jordan was receiving. this led to a so-called ""freeze-out"" on jordan, where players refused to pass the ball to him throughout the game. the controversy left jordan relatively unaffected when he returned to regular season play, and he would go on to be voted rookie of the year. the bulls finished the season 38â44 and lost to the milwaukee bucks in four games in the first round of the playoffs.

jordan's second season was cut short when he broke his foot in the third game of the year, causing him to miss 64 games. the bulls made the playoffs despite jordan's injury and a 30â52 record, at the time the fifth worst record of any team to qualify for the playoffs in nba history. jordan recovered in time to participate in the postseason and performed well upon his return. against a 1985â86 boston celtics team that is often considered one of the greatest in nba history, jordan set the still-unbroken record for points in a playoff game with 63 in game 2. the celtics, however, managed to sweep the series.

jordan had completely recovered in time for the 1986â87 season, and he had one of the most prolific scoring seasons in nba history. he became the only player other than wilt chamberlain to score 3,000 points in a season, averaging a league high 37.1 points on 48.2% shooting. in addition, jordan demonstrated his defensive prowess, as he became the first player in nba history to record 200 steals and 100 blocked shots in a season. despite jordan's success, magic johnson won the league's most valuable player award. the bulls reached 40 wins, and advanced to the playoffs for the third consecutive year. however, they were again swept by the celtics.

jordan again led the league in scoring during the 1987â88 season, averaging 35.0 ppg on 53.5% shooting and won his first league mvp award. he was also named the defensive player of the year, as he had averaged 1.6 blocks and a league high 3.16 steals per game. the bulls finished 50â32, and made it out of the first round of the playoffs for the first time in jordan's career, as they defeated the cleveland cavaliers in five games. however, the bulls then lost in five games to the more experienced detroit pistons, who were led by isiah thomas and a group of physical players known as the """".

in the 1988â89 season, jordan again led the league in scoring, averaging 32.5 ppg on 53.8% shooting from the field, along with 8 rpg and 8 apg. the bulls finished with a 47â35 record, and advanced to the eastern conference finals, defeating the cavaliers and new york knicks along the way. the cavaliers series included a career highlight for jordan when he hit ""the shot"" over craig ehlo at the buzzer in the fifth and final game of the series. however, the pistons again defeated the bulls, this time in six games, by utilizing their ""jordan rules"" method of guarding jordan, which consisted of double and triple teaming him every time he touched the ball.

the bulls entered the 1989â90 season as a team on the rise, with their core group of jordan and young improving players like scottie pippen and horace grant, and under the guidance of new coach phil jackson. jordan averaged a league leading 33.6 ppg on 52.6% shooting, to go with 6.9 rpg and 6.3 apg in leading the bulls to a 55â27 record. they again advanced to the eastern conference finals after beating the bucks and philadelphia 76ers. however, despite pushing the series to seven games, the bulls lost to the pistons for the third consecutive season.

in the 1990â91 season, jordan won his second mvp award after averaging 31.5 ppg on 53.9% shooting, 6.0 rpg, and 5.5 apg for the regular season. the bulls finished in first place in their division for the first time in 16 years and set a franchise record with 61 wins in the regular season. with scottie pippen developing into an all-star, the bulls had elevated their play. the bulls defeated the new york knicks and the philadelphia 76ers in the opening two rounds of the playoffs. they advanced to the eastern conference finals where their rival, the detroit pistons, awaited them. however, this time the bulls beat the pistons in a four-game sweep.

the bulls advanced to the nba finals for the first time in franchise history to face the los angeles lakers, who had magic johnson and james worthy, two formidable opponents. the bulls won the series four games to one, and compiled a 15â2 playoff record along the way. perhaps the best known moment of the series came in game 2 when, attempting a dunk, jordan avoided a potential sam perkins block by switching the ball from his right hand to his left in mid-air to lay the shot into the basket. in his first finals appearance, jordan posted per game averages of 31.2 points on 56% shooting from the field, 11.4 assists, 6.6 rebounds, 2.8 steals, and 1.4 blocks. jordan won his first nba finals mvp award, and he cried while holding the nba finals trophy.

jordan and the bulls continued their dominance in the 1991â92 season, establishing a 67â15 record, topping their franchise record from 1990â91. jordan won his second consecutive mvp award with averages of 30.1 points, 6.4 rebounds and 6.1 assists per game on 52% shooting. after winning a physical 7-game series over the new york knicks in the second round of the playoffs and finishing off the cleveland cavaliers in the conference finals in 6 games, the bulls met clyde drexler and the portland trail blazers in the finals. the media, hoping to recreate a magicâbird rivalry, highlighted the similarities between ""air"" jordan and clyde ""the glide"" during the pre-finals hype. in the first game, jordan scored a finals-record 35 points in the first half, including a record-setting six three-point field goals. after the sixth three-pointer, he jogged down the court shrugging as he looked courtside. marv albert, who broadcast the game, later stated that it was as if jordan was saying, ""i can't believe i'm doing this."" the bulls went on to win game 1, and defeat the blazers in six games. jordan was named finals mvp for the second year in a row and finished the series averaging 35.8 ppg, 4.8 rpg, and 6.5 apg, while shooting 53% from the floor.

in the 1992â93 season, despite a 32.6 ppg, 6.7 rpg, and 5.5 apg campaign and a second-place finish in defensive player of the year voting, jordan's streak of consecutive mvp seasons ended as he lost the award to his friend charles barkley. coincidentally, jordan and the bulls met barkley and his phoenix suns in the 1993 nba finals. the bulls won their third nba championship on a game-winning shot by john paxson and a last-second block by horace grant, but jordan was once again chicago's leader. he averaged a finals-record 41.0 ppg during the six-game series, and became the first player in nba history to win three straight finals mvp awards. he scored more than 30 points in every game of the series, including 40 or more points in 4 consecutive games. with his third finals triumph, jordan capped off a seven-year run where he attained seven scoring titles and three championships, but there were signs that jordan was tiring of his massive celebrity and all of the non-basketball hassles in his life.

during the bulls' playoff run in 1993, jordan was seen gambling in atlantic city, new jersey, the night before a game against the new york knicks. the previous year, he admitted that he had to cover $57,000 in gambling losses, and author richard esquinas wrote a book in 1993 claiming he had won $1.25â million from jordan on the golf course. nba commissioner david stern denied in 1995 and 2006 that jordan's 1993 retirement was a secret suspension by the league for gambling, but the rumor spread widely.

in 2005, jordan discussed his gambling with ed bradley of ""60 minutes"" and admitted that he made reckless decisions. jordan stated, ""yeah, i've gotten myself into situations where i would not walk away and i've pushed the envelope. is that compulsive? yeah, it depends on how you look at it. if you're willing to jeopardize your livelihood and your family, then yeah"". when bradley asked him if his gambling ever got to the level where it jeopardized his livelihood or family, jordan replied, ""no"". in 2010 ron shelton, director of ""jordan rides the bus"", said that he began working on the documentary believing that the nba had suspended him, but that research ""convinced [him it] was nonsense"".

on october 6, 1993, jordan announced his retirement, citing a loss of desire to play the game. jordan later stated that the death of his father three months earlier also shaped his decision. jordan's father was murdered on july 23, 1993, at a highway rest area in lumberton, north carolina, by two teenagers, daniel green and larry martin demery, who carjacked his luxury lexus bearing the license plate ""unc 0023"". his body was dumped in a south carolina swamp and was not discovered until august 3. the assailants were traced from calls that they made on james jordan's cell phone. the two criminals were caught, convicted at trial, and sentenced to life in prison. jordan was close to his father; as a child he had imitated his father's proclivity to stick out his tongue while absorbed in work. he later adopted it as his own signature, displaying it each time he drove to the basket. in 1996, he founded a chicago area boys & girls club and dedicated it to his father.

in his 1998 autobiography ""for the love of the game"", jordan wrote that he had been preparing for retirement as early as the summer of 1992. the added exhaustion due to the dream team run in the 1992 olympics solidified jordan's feelings about the game and his ever-growing celebrity status. jordan's announcement sent shock waves throughout the nba and appeared on the front pages of newspapers around the world.

jordan then further surprised the sports world by signing a minor league baseball contract with the chicago white sox on february 7, 1994. he reported to spring training in sarasota, florida, and was assigned to the team's minor league system on march 31, 1994. jordan has stated this decision was made to pursue the dream of his late father, who had always envisioned his son as a major league baseball player. the white sox were another team owned by bulls owner jerry reinsdorf, who continued to honor jordan's basketball contract during the years he played baseball.

in 1994, jordan played for the birmingham barons, a double-a minor league affiliate of the chicago white sox, batting .202 with three home runs, 51 runs batted in, 30 stolen bases, 114 strikeouts, 51 base on balls, and 11 errors. he also appeared for the scottsdale scorpions in the 1994 arizona fall league, batting .252 against the top prospects in baseball. on november 1, 1994, his number 23 was retired by the bulls in a ceremony that included the erection of a permanent sculpture known as ""the spirit"" outside the new united center.

in the 1993â94 season, the bulls achieved a 55â27 record without jordan in the lineup, and lost to the new york knicks in the second round of the playoffs. the 1994â95 bulls were a shell of the championship team of just two years earlier. struggling at mid-season to ensure a spot in the playoffs, chicago was 31â31 at one point in mid-march. the team received help, however, when jordan decided to return to the bulls.

in march 1995, jordan decided to quit baseball due to the ongoing major league baseball strike, as he wanted to avoid becoming a potential replacement player. on march 18, 1995, jordan announced his return to the nba through a two-word press release: ""i'm back."" the next day, jordan took to the court with the bulls to face the indiana pacers in indianapolis, scoring 19 points. the game had the highest nielsen rating of a regular season nba game since 1975. although he could have opted to wear his normal number in spite of the bulls having retired it, jordan instead wore number 45, as he had while playing baseball.

although he had not played an nba game in a year and a half, jordan played well upon his return, making a game-winning jump shot against atlanta in his fourth game back. he then scored 55 points in the next game against the knicks at madison square garden on march 28, 1995. boosted by jordan's comeback, the bulls went 13â4 to make the playoffs and advanced to the eastern conference semifinals against the orlando magic. at the end of game 1, orlando's nick anderson stripped jordan from behind, leading to the game-winning basket for the magic; he would later comment that jordan ""didn't look like the old michael jordan"" and that ""no. 45 doesn't explode like no. 23 used to.""

jordan responded by scoring 38 points in the next game, which chicago won. before the game, jordan decided that he would immediately resume wearing his former number, 23. the bulls were fined $25,000 for failing to report the impromptu number change to the nba. jordan was fined an additional $5,000 for opting to wear white sneakers when the rest of the bulls wore black. he averaged 31 points per game in the series, but orlando won the series in six games.

jordan was freshly motivated by the playoff defeat, and he trained aggressively for the 1995â96 season. the bulls were strengthened by the addition of rebound specialist dennis rodman, and the team dominated the league, starting the season at 41â3. the bulls eventually finished with the then-best regular season record in nba history, 72â10; this record was later surpassed by the 2015â16 golden state warriors. jordan led the league in scoring with 30.4 ppg and won the league's regular season and all-star game mvp awards.

in the playoffs, the bulls lost only three games in four series (miami heat 3â0, new york knicks 4â1, orlando magic 4â0). they defeated the seattle supersonics 4â2 in the nba finals to win their fourth championship. jordan was named finals mvp for a record fourth time, surpassing magic johnson's three finals mvp awards. he also achieved only the second sweep of the mvp awards in the all-star game, regular season and nba finals, willis reed having achieved the first, during the 1969â70 season. because this was jordan's first championship since his father's murder, and it was won on father's day, jordan reacted very emotionally upon winning the title, including a memorable scene of him crying on the locker room floor with the game ball.

in the 1996â97 season, the bulls started out 69â11, but missed out on a second consecutive 70-win season by losing their final two games to finish 69â13. however, this year jordan was beaten for the nba mvp award by karl malone. the bulls again advanced to the finals, where they faced malone and the utah jazz. the series against the jazz featured two of the more memorable clutch moments of jordan's career. he won game 1 for the bulls with a buzzer-beating jump shot. in game 5, with the series tied at 2, jordan played despite being feverish and dehydrated from a stomach virus. in what is known as the ""flu game"", jordan scored 38 points, including the game-deciding 3-pointer with 25 seconds remaining. the bulls won 90â88 and went on to win the series in six games. for the fifth time in as many finals appearances, jordan received the finals mvp award. during the 1997 nba all-star game, jordan posted the first triple double in all-star game history in a victorious effort; however, he did not receive the mvp award.

jordan and the bulls compiled a 62â20 record in the 1997â98 season. jordan led the league with 28.7 points per game, securing his fifth regular-season mvp award, plus honors for all-nba first team, first defensive team and the all-star game mvp. the bulls won the eastern conference championship for a third straight season, including surviving a seven-game series with the indiana pacers in the eastern conference finals; it was the first time jordan had played in a game 7 since the 1992 eastern conference semifinals with the knicks. after winning, they moved on for a rematch with the jazz in the finals.

the bulls returned to the delta center for game 6 on june 14, 1998, leading the series 3â2. jordan executed a series of plays, considered to be one of the greatest clutch performances in nba finals history. with the bulls trailing 86â83 with 41.9 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter, phil jackson called a timeout. when play resumed, jordan received the inbound pass, drove to the basket, and hit a shot over several jazz defenders, cutting the utah lead to 86â85. the jazz brought the ball upcourt and passed the ball to forward karl malone, who was set up in the low post and was being guarded by rodman. malone jostled with rodman and caught the pass, but jordan cut behind him and took the ball out of his hands for a steal. jordan then dribbled down the court and paused, eyeing his defender, jazz guard bryon russell. with 10 seconds remaining, jordan started to dribble right, then crossed over to his left, possibly pushing off russell, although the officials did not call a foul. with 5.2 seconds left, jordan gave chicago an 87â86 lead with a game-winning jumper, the climactic shot of his bulls career. afterwards, john stockton missed a game-winning three-pointer. jordan and the bulls won their sixth nba championship and second three-peat. once again, jordan was voted the finals mvp, having led all scorers averaging 33.5 points per game, including 45 in the deciding game 6. jordan's six finals mvps is a record; shaquille o'neal, magic johnson, lebron james and tim duncan are tied for second place with three apiece. the 1998 finals holds the highest television rating of any finals series in history. game 6 also holds the highest television rating of any game in nba history.

with phil jackson's contract expiring, the pending departures of scottie pippen and dennis rodman looming, and being in the latter stages of an owner-induced lockout of nba players, jordan retired for the second time on january 13, 1999. on january 19, 2000, jordan returned to the nba not as a player, but as part owner and president of basketball operations for the washington wizards. jordan's responsibilities with the wizards were comprehensive. he controlled all aspects of the wizards' basketball operations, and had the final say in all personnel matters. opinions of jordan as a basketball executive were mixed. he managed to purge the team of several highly paid, unpopular players (such as forward juwan howard and point guard rod strickland), but used the first pick in the 2001 nba draft to select high schooler kwame brown, who did not live up to expectations and was traded away after four seasons.

despite his january 1999 claim that he was ""99.9% certain"" that he would never play another nba game, in the summer of 2001 jordan expressed interest in making another comeback, this time with his new team. inspired by the nhl comeback of his friend mario lemieux the previous winter, jordan spent much of the spring and summer of 2001 in training, holding several invitation-only camps for nba players in chicago. in addition, jordan hired his old chicago bulls head coach, doug collins, as washington's coach for the upcoming season, a decision that many saw as foreshadowing another jordan return.

on september 25, 2001, jordan announced his return to the nba to play for the washington wizards, indicating his intention to donate his salary as a player to a relief effort for the victims of the september 11 attacks. in an injury-plagued 2001â02 season, he led the team in scoring (22.9 ppg), assists (5.2 apg), and steals (1.42 spg). however, torn cartilage in his right knee ended jordan's season after only 60 games, the fewest he had played in a regular season since playing 17 games after returning from his first retirement during the 1994â95 season. jordan started 53 of his 60 games for the season, averaging 24.3 points, 5.4 assists, and 6.0 rebounds, and shooting 41.9% from the field in his 53 starts. his last seven appearances were in a reserve role, in which he averaged just over 20 minutes per game.

playing in his 14th and final nba all-star game in 2003, jordan passed kareem abdul-jabbar as the all-time leading scorer in all-star game history (a record since broken by kobe bryant). that year, jordan was the only washington player to play in all 82 games, starting in 67 of them. he averaged 20.0 points, 6.1 rebounds, 3.8 assists, and 1.5 steals per game. he also shot 45% from the field, and 82% from the free throw line. even though he turned 40 during the season, he scored 20 or more points 42 times, 30 or more points nine times, and 40 or more points three times. on february 21, 2003, jordan became the first 40-year-old to tally 43 points in an nba game. during his stint with the wizards, all of jordan's home games at the mci center were sold out, and the wizards were the second most-watched team in the nba, averaging 20,172 fans a game at home and 19,311 on the road. however, neither of jordan's final two seasons resulted in a playoff appearance for the wizards, and jordan was often unsatisfied with the play of those around him. at several points he openly criticized his teammates to the media, citing their lack of focus and intensity, notably that of the number one draft pick in the 2001 nba draft, kwame brown.

with the recognition that 2002â03 would be jordan's final season, tributes were paid to him throughout the nba. in his final game at the united center in chicago, which was his old home court, jordan received a four-minute standing ovation. the miami heat retired the number 23 jersey on april 11, 2003, even though jordan never played for the team. at the 2003 all-star game, jordan was offered a starting spot from tracy mcgrady and allen iverson, but refused both. in the end, he accepted the spot of vince carter, who decided to give it up under great public pressure.

jordan played in his final nba game on april 16, 2003, in philadelphia. after scoring only 13 points in the game, jordan went to the bench with 4 minutes and 13 seconds remaining in the third quarter and his team trailing the philadelphia 76ers, 75â56. just after the start of the fourth quarter, the first union center crowd began chanting ""we want mike!"" after much encouragement from coach doug collins, jordan finally rose from the bench and re-entered the game, replacing larry hughes with 2:35 remaining. at 1:45, jordan was intentionally fouled by the 76ers' eric snow, and stepped to the line to make both free throws. after the second foul shot, the 76ers in-bounded the ball to rookie john salmons, who in turn was intentionally fouled by bobby simmons one second later, stopping time so that jordan could return to the bench. jordan received a three-minute standing ovation from his teammates, his opponents, the officials, and the crowd of 21,257 fans.

jordan played on two olympic gold medal-winning american basketball teams. he won a gold medal as a college player in the 1984 summer olympics. the team was coached by bob knight and featured players such as patrick ewing, sam perkins, chris mullin, steve alford, and wayman tisdale. jordan led the team in scoring, averaging 17.1 ppg for the tournament.

in the 1992 summer olympics, he was a member of the star-studded squad that included magic johnson and larry bird that was dubbed the ""dream team"". jordan was the only player to start all eight games in the olympics. playing limited minutes due to the frequent blowouts, jordan averaged 14.9 ppg, finishing second on the team in scoring. jordan and fellow dream team members ewing and mullin are the only american men's basketball players to win olympic gold medals as amateurs and professionals.

after his third retirement, jordan assumed that he would be able to return to his front office position as director of basketball operations with the wizards. however, his previous tenure in the wizards' front office had produced the aforementioned mixed results and may have also influenced the trade of richard ""rip"" hamilton for jerry stackhouse (although jordan was not technically director of basketball operations in 2002). on may 7, 2003, wizards owner abe pollin fired jordan as the team's president of basketball operations. jordan later stated that he felt betrayed, and that if he had known he would be fired upon retiring he never would have come back to play for the wizards.

jordan kept busy over the next few years. he stayed in shape, played golf in celebrity charity tournaments, and spent time with his family in chicago. he also promoted his jordan brand clothing line and rode motorcycles. since 2004, jordan has owned michael jordan motorsports, a professional closed-course motorcycle road racing team that competed with two suzukis in the premier superbike championship sanctioned by the american motorcyclist association (ama) until the end of the 2013 season.

on june 15, 2006, jordan bought a minority stake in the charlotte bobcats, becoming the team's second-largest shareholder behind majority owner robert l. johnson. as part of the deal, jordan took full control over the basketball side of the operation, with the title ""managing member of basketball operations."" despite jordan's previous success as an endorser, he has made an effort not to be included in charlotte's marketing campaigns. a decade earlier, jordan had made a bid to become part-owner of charlotte's original nba team, the charlotte hornets, but talks collapsed when owner george shinn refused to give jordan complete control of basketball operations.

in february 2010, it was reported that jordan was seeking majority ownership of the bobcats, who changed their nickname to the hornets in 2014. as february wore on, it became apparent that jordan and former houston rockets president george postolos were the leading contenders for ownership of the team. on february 27, the bobcats announced that johnson had reached an agreement with jordan and his group, mj basketball holdings, to buy the team pending nba approval. on march 17, the nba board of governors unanimously approved jordan's purchase, making him the first former player to become the majority owner of an nba team. it also made him the league's only african-american majority owner of an nba team.

during the 2011 nba lockout, ""the new york times"" wrote that jordan led a group of 10 to 14 hardline owners who wanted to cap the players' share of basketball-related income at 50 percent and as low as 47. journalists observed that, during the labor dispute in 1998, jordan had told washington wizards then-owner abe pollin, ""if you can't make a profit, you should sell your team."" jason whitlock of ""foxsports.com"" called jordan a ""sellout"" wanting ""current players to pay for his incompetence."" he cited jordan's executive decisions to draft disappointing players kwame brown and adam morrison.

during the 2011â12 nba season that was shortened to 66 games by the lockout, the bobcats posted a 7â59 record. their .106 winning percentage was the worst in nba history. ""i'm not real happy about the record book scenario last year. it's very, very frustrating"", jordan said later that year. during the 2019 nba offseason, jordan sold a minority piece of the hornets to gabe plotkin and daniel sundheim, retaining the majority of the team for himself.

jordan was a shooting guard who was also capable of playing as a small forward (the position he would primarily play during his second return to professional basketball with the washington wizards), and as a point guard. jordan was known throughout his career for being a strong clutch performer. with the bulls, he decided 25 games with field goals or free throws in the last 30 seconds, including two nba finals games and five other playoff contests. his competitiveness was visible in his prolific trash-talk and well-known work ethic. as the bulls organization built the franchise around jordan, management had to trade away players who were not ""tough enough"" to compete with him in practice. to help improve his defense, he spent extra hours studying film of opponents. on offense, he relied more upon instinct and improvization at game time. noted as a durable player, jordan did not miss four or more games while active for a full season from 1986â87 to 2001â02, when he injured his right knee. of the 15 seasons jordan was in the nba, he played all 82 regular season games nine times. jordan has frequently cited david thompson, walter davis, and jerry west as influences. confirmed at the start of his career, and possibly later on, jordan had a special ""love of the game clause"" written into his contract (unusual at the time) which allowed him to play basketball against anyone at any time, anywhere.

jordan had a versatile offensive game. he was capable of aggressively driving to the basket, as well as drawing fouls from his opponents at a high rate; his 8,772 free throw attempts are the 11th-highest total in nba history. as his career progressed, jordan also developed the ability to post up his opponents and score with his trademark fadeaway jump shot, using his leaping ability to ""fade away"" from block attempts. according to hubie brown, this move alone made him nearly unstoppable. despite media criticism as a ""selfish"" player early in his career, jordan's 5.3 assists per game also indicate his willingness to defer to his teammates. after shooting under 30% from three-point range in his first five seasons in the nba, including a career-low 13% in the season, jordan improved to a career-high 50% in the season. the three-point shot became more of a focus of his game from 1994â95 to 1996â97, when the nba shortened its three-point line to (from ). his three-point field-goal percentages ranged from 35% to 43% in seasons in which he attempted at least 230 three-pointers between 1989â90 and 1996â97. for a guard, jordan was also a good rebounder (6.2 per game).

in 1988, jordan was honored with the nba's defensive player of the year award and became the first nba player to win both the defensive player of the year and most valuable player awards in a career (since equaled by hakeem olajuwon, david robinson, and kevin garnett; olajuwon is the only player other than jordan to win both during the same season). in addition, he set both seasonal and career records for blocked shots by a guard, and combined this with his ball-thieving ability to become a standout defensive player. he ranks third in nba history in total steals with 2,514, trailing john stockton and jason kidd. jerry west often stated that he was more impressed with jordan's defensive contributions than his offensive ones. he was also known to have strong eyesight; broadcaster al michaels said that he was able to read baseball box scores on a 27-inch (69â cm) television clearly from about 50 feet (15â m) away.

jordan's talent was clear from his first nba season; by november he was being compared to julius erving. larry bird said that he had ""never seen anyone like him"", that jordan was ""one of a kind"" and the best player he had ever seen, and comparable to wayne gretzky as an athlete. in his first game in madison square garden against the new york knicks, jordan received a standing ovation of almost one minute. after he scored a playoff record 63 points against the boston celtics on april 20, 1986, bird described him as ""god disguised as michael jordan"".

jordan led the nba in scoring in 10 seasons (nba record) and tied wilt chamberlain's record of seven consecutive scoring titles. he was also a fixture on the nba all-defensive first team, making the roster nine times (nba record shared with gary payton, kevin garnett and kobe bryant). jordan also holds the top career regular season and playoff scoring averages of 30.1 and 33.4 points per game, respectively. by 1998, the season of his finals-winning shot against the jazz, he was well known throughout the league as a clutch performer. in the regular season, jordan was the bulls' primary threat in the final seconds of a close game and in the playoffs; he would always ask for the ball at crunch time. jordan's total of 5,987 points in the playoffs is the second-highest in nba history. he retired with 32,292 points in regular season play, placing him fifth on the nba's all-time scoring list behind kareem abdul-jabbar, karl malone, kobe bryant, and lebron james.

with five regular-season mvps (tied for second place with bill russellâonly kareem abdul-jabbar has won more, with six), six finals mvps (nba record), and three all-star game mvps, jordan is the most decorated player in nba history. jordan finished among the top three in regular-season mvp voting 10 times, and was named one of the 50 greatest players in nba history in 1996. he is one of only seven players in history to win an ncaa championship, an nba championship, and an olympic gold medal (doing so twice with the 1984 and 1992 u.s. men's basketball teams). since 1976, the year of the nba's merger with the american basketball association, jordan and pippen are the only two players to win six nba finals playing for one team. in the all-star game fan ballot, jordan received the most votes nine times, more than any other player.
many of jordan's contemporaries have said that jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time. in 1999, an espn survey of journalists, athletes and other sports figures ranked jordan the greatest north american athlete of the 20th century, above such luminaries as babe ruth and muhammad ali. jordan placed second to babe ruth in the associated press' december 1999 list of 20th century athletes. in addition, the associated press voted him the greatest basketball player of the 20th century. jordan has also appeared on the front cover of ""sports illustrated"" a record 50 times. in the september 1996 issue of ""sport"", which was the publication's 50th-anniversary issue, jordan was named the greatest athlete of the past 50 years.

jordan's athletic leaping ability, highlighted in his back-to-back slam dunk contest championships in 1987 and 1988, is credited by many people with having influenced a generation of young players. several current nba playersâincluding lebron james and dwyane wadeâhave stated that they considered jordan their role model while they were growing up. in addition, commentators have dubbed a number of next-generation players ""the next michael jordan"" upon their entry to the nba, including penny hardaway, grant hill, allen iverson, bryant, james, vince carter, and dwyane wade. although jordan was a well-rounded player, his ""air jordan"" image is also often credited with inadvertently decreasing the jump shooting skills, defense, and fundamentals of young players, a fact jordan himself has lamented. 

during his heyday, jordan did much to increase the status of the game. television ratings increased only during his time in the league. the popularity of the nba in the u.s. declined after his last title. as late as 2015, finals ratings had not returned to the level reached during his last championship-winning season.
in august 2009, the naismith memorial basketball hall of fame in springfield, massachusetts, opened a michael jordan exhibit that contained items from his college and nba careers, as well as from the 1992 ""dream team"". the exhibit also has a batting glove to signify jordan's short career in minor league baseball. after jordan received word of his acceptance into the hall of fame, he selected class of 1996 member david thompson to present him. as jordan would later explain during his induction speech in september 2009, when he was growing up in north carolina, he was not a fan of the tar heels and greatly admired thompson, who played at rival north carolina state. in september, he was inducted into the hall with several former bulls teammates in attendance, including scottie pippen, dennis rodman, charles oakley, ron harper, steve kerr, and toni kukoä. two of jordan's former coaches, dean smith and doug collins, were also among those present. his emotional reaction during his speechâwhen he began to cryâwas captured by associated press photographer stephan savoia and would later go viral on social media as the crying jordan internet meme. in 2016, president barack obama honored jordan with the presidential medal of freedom.

jordan married juanita vanoy in september 1989, and they had two sons, jeffrey and marcus, and a daughter, jasmine. jordan and vanoy filed for divorce on january 4, 2002, citing irreconcilable differences, but reconciled shortly thereafter. they again filed for divorce and were granted a final decree of dissolution of marriage on december 29, 2006, commenting that the decision was made ""mutually and amicably"". it is reported that juanita received a $168â million settlement (equivalent to $ million in ), making it the largest celebrity divorce settlement on public record at the time.

in 1991, jordan purchased a lot in highland park, illinois, to build a 56,000 square-foot (5,200â m) mansion, which was completed four years later. jordan listed his highland park mansion for sale in 2012. his two sons attended loyola academy, a private roman catholic high school located in wilmette, illinois. jeffrey graduated as a member of the 2007 graduating class and played his first collegiate basketball game on november 11, 2007, for the university of illinois. after two seasons, jeffrey left the illinois basketball team in 2009. he later rejoined the team for a third season, then received a release to transfer to the university of central florida, where marcus was attending. marcus transferred to whitney young high school after his sophomore year at loyola academy and graduated in 2009. he began attending ucf in the fall of 2009, and played three seasons of basketball for the school. jordan's nephew through his brother larry, justin jordan, played division i basketball at unc greensboro.

on july 21, 2006, a judge in cook county, illinois, determined that jordan did not owe his alleged former lover karla knafel $5â million in a breach of contract claim. jordan had allegedly paid knafel $250,000 to keep their relationship a secret. knafel claimed jordan promised her $5â million for remaining silent and agreeing not to file a paternity suit after knafel learned she was pregnant in 1991. a dna test showed jordan was not the father of the child.

he proposed to his longtime girlfriend, cuban-american model yvette prieto, on christmas 2011, and they were married on april 27, 2013, at bethesda-by-the-sea episcopal church. it was announced on november 30, 2013, that the two were expecting their first child together. on february 11, 2014, prieto gave birth to identical twin daughters named victoria and ysabel. jordan became a grandfather in 2019 when his daughter jasmine gave birth to a son, whose father is former indiana pacer rakeem christmas.

from 2001 to 2014, jordan hosted an annual golf tournament, the michael jordan celebrity invitational, that raised money for various charities. in 2006, jordan and his wife juanita pledged $5â million to chicago's hales franciscan high school. the jordan brand has made donations to habitat for humanity and a louisiana branch of the boys & girls clubs of america.

the make-a-wish foundation named jordan its chief wish ambassador in 2008. five years later, he granted his 200th wish for the organization. as of 2019, he has raised more than $5â million for the make-a-wish foundation.

in 2015, jordan donated a settlement of undisclosed size from a lawsuit against supermarkets that had used his name without permission to 23 different chicago charities. jordan funded two novant health michael jordan family clinics in charlotte, north carolina, in 2017 by giving $7â million, the biggest donation he had made at the time. one year later, after hurricane florence damaged parts of north carolina, including his former hometown of wilmington, jordan donated $2â million to relief efforts. he gave $1â million to aid the bahamas' recovery following hurricane dorian in 2019.

jordan is one of the most marketed sports figures in history. he has been a major spokesman for such brands as nike, coca-cola, chevrolet, gatorade, mcdonald's, ball park franks, rayovac, wheaties, hanes, and mci. jordan has had a long relationship with gatorade, appearing in over 20 commercials for the company since 1991, including the ""be like mike"" commercials in which a song was sung by children wishing to be like jordan.

nike created a signature shoe for him, called the ""air jordan"", in 1984. one of jordan's more popular commercials for the shoe involved spike lee playing the part of mars blackmon. in the commercials lee, as blackmon, attempted to find the source of jordan's abilities and became convinced that ""it's gotta be the shoes"". the hype and demand for the shoes even brought on a spate of ""shoe-jackings"" where people were robbed of their sneakers at gunpoint. subsequently, nike spun off the jordan line into its own division named the ""jordan brand"". the company features an impressive list of athletes and celebrities as endorsers. the brand has also sponsored college sports programs such as those of north carolina, california, georgetown, and marquette.

jordan also has been associated with the looney tunes cartoon characters. a nike commercial shown during 1992's super bowl xxvi featured jordan and bugs bunny playing basketball. the super bowl commercial inspired the 1996 live action/animated film ""space jam"", which starred jordan and bugs in a fictional story set during the former's first retirement from basketball. they have subsequently appeared together in several commercials for mci. jordan also made an appearance in the music video of michael jackson's ""jam"" (1992).

jordan's yearly income from the endorsements is estimated to be over forty million dollars. in addition, when jordan's power at the ticket gates was at its highest point, the bulls regularly sold out both their home and road games. due to this, jordan set records in player salary by signing annual contracts worth in excess of us$30â million per season. an academic study found that jordan's first nba comeback resulted in an increase in the market capitalization of his client firms of more than $1â billion.

most of jordan's endorsement deals, including his first deal with nike, were engineered by his agent, david falk. jordan has described falk as ""the best at what he does"" and that ""marketing-wise, he's great. he's the one who came up with the concept of 'air jordan.'""

in june 2010, jordan was ranked by ""forbes"" magazine as the 20th-most powerful celebrity in the world with $55â million earned between june 2009 and june 2010. according to the ""forbes"" article, jordan brand generates $1â billion in sales for nike. in june 2014, jordan was named the first nba player to become a billionaire, after he increased his stake in the charlotte hornets from 80% to 89.5%. on january 20, 2015, jordan was honored with the ""charlotte business journal""'s business person of the year for 2014. in 2017, he became a part owner of the miami marlins of major league baseball.

khan was born on 2 november 1965 into a muslim family in new delhi. he spent the first five years of his life in mangalore, where his maternal grandfather, ifthikar ahmed, served as the chief engineer of the port in the 1960s. khan's paternal grandfather, meer jan muhammad khan, was an ethnic pashtun (pathan). khan's father, meer taj mohammed khan, was an indian independence activist from peshawar who campaigned alongside the khudai khidmatgar, a nonviolent resistance movement led by abdul ghaffar khan (also known as bacha khan or the ""frontier gandhi""), for independence of the pashtuns from the british. meer was a follower of abdul ghaffar khan, and affiliated with the indian national congress. as of 2010, khan's paternal family was still living in the shah wali qataal area of peshawar's qissa khwani bazaar. they speak hindko and claim to be originally from kashmir. meer moved to new delhi in 1948 after the partition of india. khan's mother, lateef fatima, was the daughter of a senior government engineer. his parents were married in 1959. khan described himself on twitter as ""half hyderabadi (mother), half pathan (father), [and] some kashmiri (paternal grandmother)"".

khan grew up in the rajendra nagar neighbourhood of delhi. his father had several business ventures including a restaurant, and the family lived a middle-class life in rented apartments. khan attended st. columba's school in central delhi where he excelled in his studies and in sports such as hockey and football, and received the school's highest award, the sword of honour. initially khan aspired to pursue a career in sports, however owing to a shoulder injury in his early years meant that he could no longer play. instead, in his youth, he acted in stage plays and received praise for his imitations of bollywood actors, of which his favourites were dilip kumar, amitabh bachchan, and mumtaz. one of his childhood friends and acting partners was amrita singh, who became a bollywood actress. khan enrolled at hansraj college (1985â88) to earn his bachelor's degree in economics, but spent much of his time at delhi's theatre action group (tag), where he studied acting under the mentorship of theatre director barry john. after hansraj, he began studying for a master's degree in mass communications at jamia millia islamia, but left to pursue his acting career. he also attended the national school of drama in delhi during his early career in bollywood. his father died of cancer in 1981, and his mother died in 1991 from complications of diabetes. after the death of their parents, his older sister, shahnaz lalarukh, born in 1960, fell into a depressed state and khan took on the responsibility of caring for her. shahnaz continues to live with her brother and his family in their mumbai mansion.

although khan was given the birth name shahrukh khan, he prefers his name to be written as shah rukh khan, and is commonly referred to by the acronym srk. he married gauri chibber, a punjabi hindu, in a traditional hindu wedding ceremony on 25 october 1991, after a six-year courtship. they have a son aryan (born 1997) and a daughter suhana (born 2000). in 2013, they became parents of a third child, a son named abram, who was born through a surrogate mother. both his elder children have expressed interest in entering the entertainment industry; khan has stated that aryan, who is studying film at the usc school of cinematic arts in california, aspires to become a writer-director, while suhana, who served as assistant director for khan's film ""zero"" (2018), is studying drama and acting at nyu's tisch school of the arts for higher education. according to khan, while he strongly believes in islam, he also values his wife's religion. his children follow both religions; at his home the qur'an is situated next to the hindu deities.

khan's first starring role was in lekh tandon's television series ""dil dariya"", which began shooting in 1988, but production delays led to the 1989 series ""fauji"" becoming his television debut instead. in the series, which depicted a realistic look at the training of army cadets, he played the leading role of abhimanyu rai. this led to further appearances in aziz mirza's television series ""circus"" (1989â90) and mani kaul's miniseries ""idiot"" (1991). khan also played minor parts in the serials ""umeed"" (1989) and ""wagle ki duniya"" (1988â90), and in the english-language television film ""in which annie gives it those ones"" (1989). his appearances in these serials led critics to compare his look and acting style with those of the film actor dilip kumar, but khan was not interested in film acting at the time, thinking that he was not good enough.

khan changed his decision to act in films in april 1991, citing it as a way to escape the grief of his mother's death. he moved from delhi to mumbai to pursue a full-time career in bollywood, and was quickly signed to four films. his first offer was for hema malini's directorial debut ""dil aashna hai"", and by june, he had started his first shoot. his film debut was in ""deewana"", which was released in june 1992. in it he starred alongside divya bharti as the second male lead behind rishi kapoor. ""deewana"" became a box office hit and launched khan's bollywood career; he earned the filmfare best male debut award for his performance. also released in 1992 were khan's first films as the male lead, ""chamatkar"", ""dil aashna hai"", and the comedy ""raju ban gaya gentleman"", which was his first of many collaborations with the actress juhi chawla. his initial film roles saw him play characters who displayed energy and enthusiasm. according to arnab ray of ""daily news and analysis"", khan brought a new kind of acting as he was ""sliding down stairs on a slab of ice, cartwheeling, somersaulting, lips trembling, eyes trembling, bringing to the screen the kind of physical energyâ ... visceral, intense, maniacal one moment and cloyingly boyish the next.""

among his 1993 releases, khan garnered the most appreciation for portraying villainous roles in two box office hits: an obsessive lover in ""darr"", and a murderer in ""baazigar"". ""darr"" marked the first of khan's many collaborations with filmmaker yash chopra and his company yash raj films. khan's stammering and the use of the phrase ""i love you, k-k-k-kiran"" were popular with audiences. for ""darr"" he received a nomination for the filmfare award for best performance in a negative role, also known as the best villain award, but lost to paresh rawal for ""sir"". ""baazigar"", in which khan played an ambiguous avenger who murders his girlfriend, shocked indian audiences with an unexpected violation of the standard bollywood formula. in ""the cambridge companion to modern indian culture"", sonal khullar called the character ""the consummate anti-hero"". his performance in ""baazigar"", which would be his first of many appearances with actress kajol, won khan his first filmfare award for best actor. in 2003, the ""encyclopedia of hindi cinema"" stated that khan ""defied the image of the conventional hero in both these films and created his own version of the revisionist hero"". also in 1993, khan performed a nude scene with deepa sahi in ""maya memsaab"", although parts of it were censored by the central board of film certification. the ensuing controversy prompted him to eschew such scenes in future roles.

in 1994, khan played a love-struck musician in kundan shah's comedy-drama film ""kabhi haan kabhi naa"" opposite deepak tijori and suchitra krishnamurthy, which he later professed was his favourite role. his performance earned him a filmfare critics award for best performance, and in a retrospective review from 2004, sukanya verma of rediff.com referred to it as khan's best performance, saying ""he is spontaneous, vulnerable, boyish, mischievous and acting straight from the heart."" also in 1994, khan won the filmfare best villain award for his role as an obsessive lover in ""anjaam"", co-starring madhuri dixit and deepak tijori. at the time, playing antagonistic roles was considered risky to a leading man's career in bollywood. ray subsequently credited khan for taking ""insane risks"" and ""pushing the envelope"" by choosing to play such characters, through which he established his career in bollywood. the director mukul s. anand called him ""the new face of the industry"" at the time.

khan starred in seven films in 1995, the first of which was rakesh roshan's melodramatic thriller ""karan arjun"". co-starring salman khan and kajol, it became the second-highest-grossing film of the year in india. his most significant release that year was aditya chopra's directorial debut, the romance ""dilwale dulhania le jayenge"", in which he played a young non-resident indian (nri) who falls in love with kajol's character during a trip across europe. khan was initially reticent to portray the role of a lover, but this film is credited with establishing him as a ""romantic hero"". lauded by both critics and the public, it became the year's highest grossing production in india and abroad and was declared an ""all time blockbuster"" by box office india, with a gross of over worldwide. it is the longest-running film in the history of indian cinema; it is still showing at the maratha mandir theatre in mumbai after more than 1000 weeks as of early 2015. the film won ten filmfare awards, including the second of khan's best actor awards. the director and critic raja sen said, ""khan gives a fabulous performance, redefining the lover for the 1990s with great panache. he's cool and flippant, but sincere enough to appeal to the [audience]. the performance itself is, like the best in the business, played well enough to come across as effortless, as non-acting.""

in 1996, all four of khan's releases failed critically and commercially, but the following year, his starring role opposite aditya pancholi and juhi chawla in aziz mirza's romantic comedy ""yes boss"" earned him accolades that included a filmfare best actor nomination. later in 1997, he starred in subhash ghai's diasporic-themed social drama ""pardes"", portraying arjun, a musician facing a moral dilemma. ""india today"" cites it as one of the first major bollywood pictures to succeed in the united states.
khan's final release of 1997 was a second collaboration with yash chopra in the popular musical romance ""dil to pagal hai"". he portrayed rahul, a stage director caught in a love triangle between madhuri dixit and karisma kapoor. the film and his performance met with critical praise, winning khan his third best actor award at filmfare.

khan performed the lead role in three films and made one special appearance in 1998. in his first release of the year, he played a double role opposite juhi chawla and sonali bendre in mahesh bhatt's action comedy ""duplicate"", the first of his many collaborations with yash johar's production company dharma productions. the film was not well received, but ""india today"" lauded khan for his energetic performance. the same year, khan won critical praise for his performance as an all india radio correspondent who develops an infatuation for a mysterious terrorist (manisha koirala) in ""dil se.."", the third instalment of mani ratnam's trilogy of terror films. in his final release of the year, he portrayed a college student in karan johar's romance ""kuch kuch hota hai"", in which he was involved in a love triangle along with kajol and rani mukerji. the writer anjana motihar chandra has referred to the picture as ""the"" blockbuster of the 1990s, a ""pot-pourri of romance, comedy, and entertainment."" khan won the best actor award at the filmfare awards ceremony for the second consecutive year, although he and several critics believed his performance to have been overshadowed by that of kajol.

the roles in this phase of his career, and the series of romantic comedies and family dramas that followed, earned khan widespread adulation from audiences, particularly teenagers, and according to author anupama chopra, established him as an icon of romance in india. he continued to have frequent professional associations with yash chopra, aditya chopra, and karan johar, who moulded his image and made him into a superstar. khan became a romantic leading man without ever actually kissing any of his co-stars, although he broke this rule in 2012, after strong urging by yash chopra.

khan's only release in 1999 was ""baadshah"", in which he starred opposite twinkle khanna. although the film underperformed at the box office, it earned him a filmfare award nomination for best performance in a comic role, which he lost to govinda for ""haseena maan jaayegi"". khan became a producer in 1999 in a collaboration with the actress juhi chawla and the director aziz mirza for a production company called dreamz unlimited. the company's first production, ""phir bhi dil hai hindustani"" (2000), starring khan and chawla, was a commercial failure. it was released one week after ""kaho naa... pyaar hai"", starring hrithik roshan, then a newcomer, who critics believed overshadowed khan. swapna mitter of rediff.com spoke of khan's predictable mannerisms, saying ""frankly, it's high time he innovated his act a little."" khan did a supporting role in kamal hassan's ""hey ram"" (2000), which was made simultaneously in tamil and hindi. he thereby made his tamil debut by playing the role of an archaeologist named amjad khan. he performed free of charge as he wanted to work with kamal haasan. on khan's performance, t. krithika reddy of ""the hindu"" wrote, ""shah rukh khan, as usual comes up with an impeccable performance.""

in 2001, dreamz unlimited attempted a comeback with khan portraying the title role in santosh sivan's historical epic ""aåoka"", a partly fictionalised account of the life of emperor ashoka. the film was screened at the venice film festival and the 2001 toronto international film festival to a positive response, but it performed poorly at indian box offices. as losses continued to mount for the production company, khan was forced to close srkworld.com, a company that he had started along with dreamz unlimited. in december 2001, khan suffered a spinal injury while performing an action sequence for a special appearance in krishna vamsi's """". he was subsequently diagnosed with a prolapsed disc, and attempted multiple alternative therapies. none of these provided a permanent solution to the injury, which caused him severe pain while shooting several of his films. by the beginning of 2003, his condition had worsened to the point that he had to undergo anterior cervical discectomy and fusion surgery at wellington hospital, london. khan resumed shooting in june 2003, but he reduced his workload and the number of film roles he accepted annually.
successes during this time included aditya chopra's ""mohabbatein"" (2000), and karan johar's family drama ""kabhi khushi kabhie gham..."" (2001), which khan cites as a turning point in his career. both films co-starred amitabh bachchan as an authoritarian figure, and presented ideological struggles between the two men. khan's performances in the films were met with wide public appreciation, and he was awarded his second filmfare critics award for best actor for ""mohabbatein"". ""kabhi khushi kabhie gham..."" remained the top-grossing indian production of all time in the overseas market for the next five years.

in 2002, khan played the title role as a rebellious alcoholic opposite aishwarya rai in sanjay leela bhansali's period romance ""devdas"". at a cost of over , it was the most expensive bollywood film ever made at the time, yet recovered its costs, earning worldwide. the film earned numerous accolades including 10 filmfare awards, with best actor for khan, and a bafta award for best film not in the english language. khan next starred in ""kal ho naa ho"" (2003), a comedy-drama written by karan johar and set in new york city, which became the second-highest-grossing film domestically and the top-grossing bollywood film in external markets that year. co-starring with jaya bachchan, saif ali khan, and preity zinta, khan received critical praise for his portrayal of aman mathur, a man with a fatal heart disease, with critics praising his emotional impact upon audiences. conflict broke out between khan and the other partners of dreamz unlimited over the failure to cast juhi chawla in their 2003 production of aziz mirza's ""chalte chalte"", and they parted ways, despite the film's success.

2004 was a critically and commercially successful year for khan. he transformed dreamz unlimited into red chillies entertainment, adding his wife gauri as a producer. in the company's first production, he starred in farah khan's directorial debut, the action comedy masala film ""main hoon na"". a fictionalised account of indiaâpakistan relations, it was viewed by some commentators as a conscious effort to move away from the stereotypical portrayal of pakistan as the constant villain. khan then played an indian air force pilot who falls in love with a pakistani woman (preity zinta) in yash chopra's romance film ""veer-zaara"", which was screened at the 55th berlin film festival to critical praise. it was the highest earning film of 2004 in india, with a worldwide gross of over , and ""main hoon na"" was the second-highest earner with .
in his final release of 2004, khan starred as a nasa scientist who patriotically returns to india to rekindle his roots in ashutosh gowariker's social drama ""swades"" (meaning ""homeland""), which became the first indian picture to be shot inside the nasa research centre at the kennedy space center in florida.
film scholar stephen teo refers to the picture as an example of ""bollywoodised realism"", displaying a transcendence in conventional narrative and audience expectation in hindi cinema. in december 2013, ""the times of india"" reported that khan found filming the picture such an emotionally overwhelming and life-changing experience that he had still not viewed the film. derek elley of ""variety"" found khan's performance ""unsettling"" as ""a self-satisfied expatriate determined to bring western values to poor indian peasants"", but several film critics, including jitesh pillai, believed it to have been his finest acting to date. he was nominated for the filmfare best actor award for all three of his 2004 releases and eventually won the award for ""swades"". ""filmfare"" later included his performance in the 2010 issue of bollywood's ""top 80 iconic performances"".

in 2005, khan starred in amol palekar's fantasy drama, ""paheli"". the film was india's submission for the best foreign language film at the 79th academy awards. he later collaborated with karan johar for the third time in the musical romantic drama ""kabhi alvida naa kehna"" (2006), the story of two unhappily married people in new york city who begin extramarital affairs. the film, which featured an ensemble cast including amitabh bachchan, preity zinta, abhishek bachchan, rani mukerji and kirron kher, emerged as india's highest-grossing film in the overseas market, earning more than worldwide. both his roles in ""kabhi alvida naa kehna"" and the action film ""don"", a remake of the 1978 film of the same name, earned khan best actor nominations at the filmfare awards, despite his performance as the titular character in ""don"" being negatively compared to that of amitabh bachchan in the original film.
in 2007, khan portrayed a disgraced hockey player who coaches the indian women's national hockey team to world cup success in yash raj films' semi-fictional ""chak de! india"". bhaichand patel notes that khan, who had a background in the sport playing for his university's hockey team, essentially portrayed himself as a ""cosmopolitan, liberal, indian muslim"". faring well in both india and abroad, khan garnered another filmfare award for best actor for his performance, which rajeev masand of cnn-ibn considers to have been ""without any of his typical trappings, without any of his trademark quirks"", portraying kabir khan ""like a real flesh-and-blood human being"". ""filmfare"" included his performance in their 2010 issue of the ""top 80 iconic performances"". in the same year, khan starred
alongside arjun rampal, deepika padukone and shreyas talpade in farah khan's reincarnation melodrama ""om shanti om"", portraying a 1970s junior artiste who is reborn as a 2000s era superstar. the film became the highest grossing indian motion picture of 2007, both domestically and abroad. ""om shanti om"" earned khan his second nomination of the year for best actor at filmfare. khalid mohammed from ""hindustan times"" wrote, ""the enterprise belongs to shah rukh khan, who tackles comedy, high drama and action with his signature stylespontaneous and intuitively intelligent"".

khan collaborated for the third time with aditya chopra on the romantic drama ""rab ne bana di jodi"" (2008) opposite anushka sharma, at that time a newcomer. he played surinder sahni, a shy man with low self-esteem, whose love for his young arranged wife (sharma) causes him to transform himself into raj, a boisterous alter-ego. rachel saltz of ""the new york times"" believed the dual role to have been ""tailor-made"" for khan, giving him the opportunity to display his talents, although deep contractor from ""epilogue"" thought khan displayed greater strength in the role of surinder and weakness in the role of monologue-prone raj. in december 2008, khan suffered a shoulder injury while filming a small role in mudassar aziz's ""dulha mil gaya"". he underwent extensive physiotherapy sessions at the time but the pain left him almost immobile and he had arthroscopic surgery in february 2009. he performed an extended, special appearance in the 2009 film ""billu"", playing bollywood superstar sahir khana fictionalised version of himself, wherein he performed musical item numbers with actresses kareena kapoor, priyanka chopra, and deepika padukone. as head of the film's production company, red chillies, khan made the call to change the title of the film from ""billu barber"" to ""billu"" after hairdressers across the country complained that the word ""barber"" was derogatory. the company covered up the offending word on billboards that had already been installed with the original title.

after refusing the role that subsequently went to anil kapoor in danny boyle's ""slumdog millionaire"" (2008), khan began shooting ""my name is khan"" (2010), his fourth collaboration with director karan johar and his sixth with kajol. the film is based on a true story and set against the backdrop of perceptions of islam after the 11 september attacks. khan plays rizwan khan, a muslim suffering from mild asperger syndrome who sets out on a journey across america to meet the country's president, in a role that film scholar stephen teo sees as a ""symbol of assertive rasa values"" and another example of khan representing nri identity in global bollywood. to provide an accurate portrayal of a sufferer without disparagement, khan spent several months researching his role by reading books, watching videos and talking to people affected by the condition. upon release, ""my name is khan"" became one of the highest grossing bollywood films of all time outside india, and earned khan his eighth filmfare award for best actor, equalling the record for the most wins in the category with actor dilip kumar. jay wesissberg from ""variety"" noted how khan portrayed the asperger's sufferer with ""averted eyes, springy steps, [and] stuttered repetitions of memorized texts"", believing it to have been a ""standout performance sure to receive the autism society's gold seal of approval"".

in 2011, khan starred alongside arjun rampal and kareena kapoor in anubhav sinha's superhero film ""ra.one"", his first work in this subgenre, as a favour to his children. the film follows the story of a london-based videogame designer who creates a villainous character who escapes into the real world. it was billed as bollywood's most expensive production; it had an estimated budget of . despite negative media coverage of the film's box office performance, ""ra.one"" was a financial success with a gross of . the film, and khan's portrayal of a dual role, received mixed reviews; while most critics praised his performance as the robotic superhero g.one, though they criticised his portrayal of the videogame designer shekhar. khan's second release of 2011 was ""don 2"", a sequel to ""don"" (2006). to prepare for his role, khan exercised extensively and performed most of the stunts himself. his performance earned him positive reviews from critics; nikhat kazmi of ""the times of india"" said, ""shah rukh remains in command and never loses his foothold, neither through the dramatic sequences nor through the action cuts"". the year's highest grossing bollywood production abroad, it was showcased at the 62nd berlin international film festival.

khan's only release in 2012 was yash chopra's last picture, the romantic drama ""jab tak hai jaan"", which saw him once again in a romantic role, starring opposite katrina kaif and anushka sharma. cnn-ibn considered the overall performance by khan to have been one of his finest to date, but believed that khan's first screen kiss of his career with katrina kaif, twenty years his junior, was an awkward one. ""jab tak hai jaan"" was a moderate financial success earning over worldwide. the film was showcased at the 2012 marrakech international film festival in morocco, along with ""kabhi khushi kabhie gham..."", ""veer-zaara"", and ""don 2"". at the following zee cine awards, khan performed a tribute to the late yash chopra along with kaif, sharma, and several of chopra's other past heroines.

in 2013, khan starred in rohit shetty's action comedy ""chennai express"" for red chillies entertainment, a film which earned mixed critical reviews and a fair amount of criticism for its perceived disparagement of south indian culture, although the film included a tribute to tamil cinema star rajinikanth. the critic khalid mohamed thought that khan overacted in the film and criticised him for ""re-rendering every old trick in the acting book"". despite the criticism, the film broke many box office records for hindi films in both india and abroad, surpassing ""3 idiots"" to briefly become the highest grossing bollywood film of all time, with a gross of almost in worldwide ticket sales. on 7 march 2013a day before international women's day""the times of india"" reported that khan had requested a new convention with the name of his lead female co-stars appearing above his own in the credits. he claimed that the women in his life, including his co-stars, have been the reason for his success. in 2014, the actor was featured in farah khan's ensemble action comedy ""happy new year"", which co-starred deepika padukone, abhishek bachchan and boman irani; his third collaboration with the director. although khan's unidimensional character was criticised, the film became a major commercial success grossing worldwide.

khan next appeared alongside kajol, varun dhawan and kriti sanon in rohit shetty's action comedy ""dilwale"" (2015). the film garnered mixed reviews, though it was financially profitable with a gross of . namrata joshi of ""the hindu"" commented, ""with ""dilwale"", rohit shetty goes hopelessly wrong despite much that he had at his disposal, including a power-packed cast and producer"". joshi also felt that the attempt to repackage khan and kajol had backfired. he then took on dual parts of a superstar and his doppelgã¤nger fan in maneesh sharma's action thriller ""fan"" (2016). peter bradshaw of ""the guardian"" considered the film to be ""exhausting, bizarre yet watchable"" and thought that khan was aptly ""creepy"" as the obsessive admirer. the film underperformed at the box office, and trade journalists attributed this failure to the film's non-conformity to mainstream formula. later that year, khan portrayed the supporting part of a therapist to an aspiring cinematographer (played by alia bhatt) in gauri shinde's coming-of-age film ""dear zindagi"".

in rahul dholakia's action crime film ""raees"" (2017), khan took on the part of the titular anti-heroa bootlegger turned mobster in 1980s gujarat. in a typical mixed review, pratim d. gupta of ""the telegraph"" thought khan's performance to be ""inconsistent, intense and power-packed at times, but often slipping out of character into his usual mix of stock mannerisms"". commercially, the film was a modest success, earning about worldwide. khan returned to the romantic genre with the role of a tourist guide who falls in love with a traveller (played by anushka sharma) in imtiaz ali's ""jab harry met sejal"" (2017). writing for ""mint"", uday bhatia criticised khan's pairing with sharma, 22 years his junior, writing that khan had performed ""similar gestures of love decades ago to actors his own age"". the film proved to be a box office flop. khan next reunited with sharma and katrina kaif in aanand l rai's romantic drama ""zero"" (2018), in which he played bauua singh, a dwarf involved in a love triangle. the film received mixed reviews with praise directed to khan's performance. writing for ""hindustan times"", raja sen commended his ""dominating performance and tremendous energy"" and anna m. m. vetticad of ""firstpost"" called him an ""excellent fit"" for the role for allowing his ""naturally energetic personality, comic timing and charm to take flight"". commercially, it failed to do well. according to a box office india report, khan's stardom was impacted by his films failing to do well.

khan co-produced three films from 1999 to 2003 as a founding member of the partnership dreamz unlimited. after the partnership was dissolved, he and gauri restructured the company as red chillies entertainment, which includes divisions dealing with film and television production, visual effects, and advertising. as of 2015, the company has produced or co-produced at least nine films. either khan or gauri are usually given production credits, and he has appeared in most of the films, either in the lead role, or in a guest appearance. khan was involved in several aspects of the making of ""ra.one"" (2011). aside from acting, he produced the film, volunteered to write the console game script, dubbed for it, oversaw its technical development, and wrote the digital comics based on the film's characters. khan has occasionally done playback singing for his films. in ""josh"" (2000) he sang the popular song ""apun bola tu meri laila"". he also sang in ""don"" (2006) and ""jab tak hai jaan"" (2012). for ""always kabhi kabhi"" (2011), which was produced by red chillies, khan participated in the lyrical composition.

in addition to his early television serial appearances, khan has hosted numerous televised awards shows, including the filmfare, zee cine, and screen awards. in 2007, he replaced amitabh bachchan for one season as the host of ""kaun banega crorepati"", the indian version of ""who wants to be a millionaire?"", and a year later, khan began hosting ""kya aap paanchvi pass se tez hain?"", the indian version of ""are you smarter than a 5th grader?"". in 2011, he returned to television, appearing on imagine tv's """", the indian version of ""wipeout""; scenes featuring khan were shot at the yash raj studios in mumbai. contrary to his earlier television anchoring jobs, ""zor ka jhatka: total wipeout"" performed poorly. it aired for only one season and became the lowest rated show hosted by a bollywood star. in 2017, khan began hosting ""ted talks india nayi soch"", a talk show produced by ted conferences, llc which started aired on star plus.

khan is a frequent stage performer and has participated in several world tours and concerts. in 1997, he performed in asha bhosle's moments in time concert in malaysia, and returned the following year to perform with karisma kapoor for the shahrukhâkarisma: live in malaysia concert. the same year, he participated in the awesome foursome world tour across the united kingdom, canada, and the united states along with juhi chawla, akshay kumar and kajol, and resumed the tour in malaysia the following year. in 2002, khan featured with amitabh bachchan, aamir khan, preity zinta, and aishwarya rai in the show from india with love at manchester's old trafford and london's hyde park; the event was attended by more than 100,000â people. khan performed alongside rani mukherji, arjun rampal and ishaa koppikar in a 2010 concert at the army stadium in dhaka, bangladesh. the next year he joined shahid kapoor and priyanka chopra in the friendship concert, celebrating 150â years of indiaâsouth africa friendship in durban, south africa.

khan started an association with the ""temptations"" series of concert tours by singing, dancing, and performing skits alongside arjun rampal, priyanka chopra, and other bollywood stars in temptations 2004, a stage show that toured 22â venues across the world. the show played to 15,000â spectators at dubai's festival city arena. in 2008, khan set up temptation reloaded, a series of concerts that toured several countries, including the netherlands. another tour was held with bipasha basu and others in 2012 in jakarta, and in 2013 another series of concerts visited auckland, perth and sydney. in 2014, khan performed in slam! the tour in the us, canada, and london, and also hosted the indian premiere of the live talent show, got talent world stage live.

in 2008, khan, in partnership with juhi chawla and her husband jay mehta, acquired ownership rights for the franchise representing kolkata in the twenty20 cricket tournament indian premier league (ipl) for , and named the team kolkata knight riders (kkr). , kkr was one of the richest teams in the ipl, with a brand value of . the team performed poorly on the field during the first three years. their performance improved over time, and they became the champions for the first time in 2012 and repeated the feat in 2014. the knight riders hold the record for the longest winning streak by any indian team in t20s (14).

khan performed alongside sunidhi chauhan and shriya saran at the opening ceremony of the ipl 2011 season, where they danced to tamil songs. he appeared again in 2013 alongside katrina kaif, deepika padukone and pitbull. in may 2012, the mumbai cricket association (mca) banned him from the wankhede stadium for five years for getting into an argument with the security staff after a match between kkr and the mumbai indians. khan had, however, stated that he acted only after children, including his daughter, were being ""manhandled"" by the security staff and that the officials were extremely high-handed and aggressive in their behavior, he had been abused with communal indecent comment. later mca officials had accused him of being drunk in one version of the story, hitting the guard and of completely uncharacteristically abusing a female supporter of mumbai indians after the match in another version of the story, which khan had maintained it was done to support their action and for cheap publicity. wankhede guard later contradicted mca officials' claim and said shah rukh khan had not hit him. khan later apologized to his fans after his team won the final match. mca revoked the ban in 2015 and in 2016, mumbai police informed that no 'cognisable offence' was made out against khan and they had come to the conclusion that shah rukh khan was not drunk and did not use abusive language before minors at the wankhede stadium in 2012.

shah rukh khan receives a considerable amount of media coverage in india, and is often referred to as ""king khan"", ""the baadshah of bollywood"", or ""the king of bollywood"". anupama chopra cites him as an ""ever present celebrity"", with two or three films a year, constantly running television ads, print ads, and gigantic billboards lining the streets of indian cities. he is the object of a sometimes fanatical following, with a fan base estimated to exceed one billion. ""newsweek"" named khan as one of their fifty most powerful people globally in 2008 and called him ""the world's biggest movie star"". in 2011 he was declared ""the biggest movie star you've never heard of...perhaps the world's biggest movie star, period"" by steven zeitchik of the ""los angeles times"" and has been called the world's biggest movie star in other international media outlets. according to a popularity survey, 3.2 billion people around the world know shah rukh khan, more than who know tom cruise. khan is one of the wealthiest celebrities in india, topping the ""forbes"" india's ""celebrity 100 list"" in 2012, 2013 and 2015. his wealth has been estimated at us$400â600 million. khan owns several properties in india and abroad, including a apartment in london, and a villa on the palm jumeirah in dubai.

khan frequently appears on listings of the most popular, stylish and influential people in india. he has regularly featured among the top ten on ""the times of india""s list of the 50 most desirable men in india, and in a 2007 poll by the magazine ""eastern eye"" he was named the sexiest man in asia. khan is often referred to as ""brand srk"" by media organisations because of his many brand endorsement and entrepreneurship ventures. he is one of the highest paid bollywood endorsers and one of the most visible celebrities in television advertising, with up to a six per cent share of the television advertisement market. khan has endorsed brands including pepsi, nokia, hyundai, dish tv, d'decor, lux and tag heuer. books have been published about him, and his popularity has been documented in several non-fiction films, including the two-part documentary ""the inner and outer world of shah rukh khan"" (2005), and the discovery travel & living channel's ten-part miniseries ""living with a superstarshah rukh khan"" (2010). in 2007, khan became the third indian actor to have his wax statue installed at london's madame tussauds museum, after aishwarya rai and amitabh bachchan. additional versions of the statue were installed at madame tussauds' museums in los angeles, hong kong, new york and washington.

khan has been brand ambassador of various governmental campaigns, including pulse polio and the national aids control organisation. he is a member of the board of directors of the make-a-wish foundation in india, and in 2011 he was appointed by unops as the first global ambassador of the water supply and sanitation collaborative council. he has recorded a series of public service announcements championing good health and proper nutrition, and joined india's health ministry and unicef in a nationwide child immunisation campaign. in 2011, he received unesco's pyramide con marni award for his charitable commitment to provide education for children, becoming the first indian to win the accolade. in 2014, khan became the ambassador for interpol's campaign ""turn back crime"". in 2015, khan received a privileged degree from the university of edinburgh, scotland. in 2018, khan was honoured by the world economic forum with their annual crystal award for his leadership in championing children's and women's rights in india.

khan is one of the most decorated bollywood actors. he has received 14â filmfare awards from 30â nominations and special awards, including eight for best actor; he is tied for the most in the category with dilip kumar. khan has won the filmfare best actor award for ""baazigar"" (1993), ""dilwale dulhania le jayenge"" (1995), ""dil to pagal hai"" (1997), ""kuch kuch hota hai"" (1998), ""devdas"" (2002), ""swades"" (2004), ""chak de! india"" (2007) and ""my name is khan"" (2010). at times, he has garnered as many as three of the five total filmfare best actor nominations.

although he has never won a national film award, he was awarded the padma shri by the government of india in 2005. the government of france has awarded him both the ordre des arts et des lettres (2007), and the fifth degree of the french legion of honour, the chevalier lã©gion d'honneur (2014). khan has received five honorary doctorates; the first from the university of bedfordshire in 2009, the second from the university of edinburgh in 2015, the third from maulana azad national urdu university in 2016, and his latest from the university of law and la trobe university in 2019.

azim premji,"
azim hashim premji (born 24 july 1945) is an indian business tycoon, investor, engineer, and philanthropist, who is the chairman of wipro limited. he is informally known as the czar of the indian it industry. he was responsible for guiding wipro through four decades of diversification and growth to finally emerge as one of the global leaders in the software industry. in 2010, he was voted among the 20 most powerful men in the world by asiaweek. he has twice been listed among the 100 most influential people by time magazine, once in 2004 and more recently in 2011.

he is currently the tenth richest person in india with an estimated net worth of us$7.2 billion as of october 2019. in 2013, he agreed to give away at least half of his wealth by signing the giving pledge. premji started with a $2.2 billion donation to the azim premji foundation, focused on education in india.

premji was born in bombay, india in a nizari ismaili shia muslim family with origins from kutch in gujarat. his father was a noted businessman and was known as ""rice king of burma"". after partition, when jinnah invited his father muhammed hashem premji to come to pakistan, he turned down the request and chose to remain in india.

premji has a bachelor of science in electrical engineering degree (equivalent to a bachelor of engineering degree) from stanford university, usa. he is married to yasmeen. the couple have two children, rishad and tariq. rishad is currently the chief strategy officer of it business, wipro.

in 1945, muhammed hashim premji incorporated western indian vegetable products ltd, based at amalner, a small town in the jalgaon district of maharashtra. it used to manufacture cooking oil under the brand name sunflower vanaspati, and a laundry soap called 787, a byproduct of oil manufacture. in 1966, on the news of his father's death, the then 21-year-old azim premji returned home from stanford university, where he was studying engineering, to take charge of wipro. the company, which was called western indian vegetable products at the time, dealt in hydrogenated oil manufacturing but azim premji later diversified the company to bakery fats, ethnic ingredient based toiletries, hair care soaps, baby toiletries, lighting products, and hydraulic cylinders. in the 1980s, the young entrepreneur, recognising the importance of the emerging it field, took advantage of the vacuum left behind by the expulsion of ibm from india, changed the company name to ""wipro"" and entered the high-technology sector by manufacturing minicomputers under technological collaboration with an american company sentinel computer corporation. thereafter premji made a focused shift from soaps to software.

premji has been recognised by business week as one of the ""greatest entrepreneurs"" for being responsible for wipro emerging as one of the world's fastest growing companies.

in 2000, he was conferred an honorary doctorate by the manipal academy of higher education. in 2006, azim premji was awarded lakshya business visionary by national institute of industrial engineering, mumbai. in 2009, he was awarded an honorary doctorate from wesleyan university in middletown, connecticut for his outstanding philanthropic work. in 2015, mysore university conferred an honorary doctorate on him.

in 2005, the government of india honoured him with the title of padma bhushan for his outstanding work in trade and commerce.

in 2011, he has been awarded padma vibhushan, the second highest civilian award by the government of india.

in april 2017, india today magazine ranked him 9th in india's 50 most powerful people of 2017 list.

in 2001, he founded azim premji foundation,a non-profit organization.

in december 2010, he pledged to donate us$2 billion for improving school education in india. this has been done by transferring 213 million equity shares of wipro ltd, held by a few entities controlled by him, to the azim premji trust. this donation is the largest of its kind in india. in march 2019, premji pledged an additional 34% of wipro stock held by him to the foundation. at a current value of about usd 7.5 billion, this allocation will bring the total endowment from him to the foundation to usd 21 billion.

premji has said that being rich ""did not thrill"" him. he became the first indian to sign up for the giving pledge, a campaign led by warren buffett and bill gates, to encourage the wealthiest people to make a commitment to give most of their wealth to philanthropic causes. he is the third non-american after richard branson and david sainsbury to join this philanthropy club.

in april 2013 he said that he has already given more than 25 per cent of his personal wealth to charity.

in july 2015, he gave away an additional 18% of his stake in wipro, taking his total contribution so far to 39%.

marie curie,"
marie skåodowska curie ( , , ; born maria salomea skåodowska; 7 november 18674 july 1934) was a polish and naturalized-french physicist and chemist who conducted pioneering research on radioactivity. she was the first woman to win a nobel prize, is the only woman to win the nobel prize twice, and is the only person to win the nobel prize in two different scientific fields. she was part of the curie family legacy of five nobel prizes. she was also the first woman to become a professor at the university of paris, and in 1995 became the first woman to be entombed on her own merits in the panthã©on in paris.

she was born in warsaw, in what was then the kingdom of poland, part of the russian empire. she studied at warsaw's clandestine flying university and began her practical scientific training in warsaw. in 1891, aged 24, she followed her older sister bronisåawa to study in paris, where she earned her higher degrees and conducted her subsequent scientific work. she shared the 1903 nobel prize in physics with her husband pierre curie and physicist henri becquerel. she won the 1911 nobel prize in chemistry.

her achievements included the development of the theory of ""radioactivity"" (a term she coined), techniques for isolating radioactive isotopes, and the discovery of two elements, polonium and radium. under her direction, the world's first studies were conducted into the treatment of neoplasms using radioactive isotopes. she founded the curie institutes in paris and in warsaw, which remain major centres of medical research today. during world war i she developed mobile radiography units to provide x-ray services to field hospitals.

while a french citizen, marie skåodowska curie, who used both surnames, never lost her sense of polish identity. she taught her daughters the polish language and took them on visits to poland. she named the first chemical element she discovered ""polonium"", after her native country.

marie curie died in 1934, aged 66, at a sanatorium in sancellemoz (haute-savoie), france, of aplastic anemia from exposure to radiation in the course of her scientific research and in the course of her radiological work at field hospitals during world war i.

maria skåodowska was born in warsaw, in congress poland in the russian empire, on 7 november 1867, the fifth and youngest child of well-known teachers bronisåawa, ""nã©e"" boguska, and wåadysåaw skåodowski. the elder siblings of maria (nicknamed ""mania"") were zofia (born 1862, nicknamed ""zosia""), (born 1863, nicknamed ""jã³zio""), bronisåawa (born 1865, nicknamed ""bronia"") and (born 1866, nicknamed ""hela"").

on both the paternal and maternal sides, the family had lost their property and fortunes through patriotic involvements in polish national uprisings aimed at restoring poland's independence (the most recent had been the january uprising of 1863â65). this condemned the subsequent generation, including maria and her elder siblings, to a difficult struggle to get ahead in life. maria's paternal grandfather, , had been a respected teacher in lublin, where he taught the young bolesåaw prus, who would become a leading figure in polish literature.

wåadysåaw skåodowski taught mathematics and physics, subjects that maria was to pursue, and was also director of two warsaw ""gymnasia"" for boys. after russian authorities eliminated laboratory instruction from the polish schools, he brought much of the laboratory equipment home, and instructed his children in its use. he was eventually fired by his russian supervisors for pro-polish sentiments, and forced to take lower-paying posts; the family also lost money on a bad investment, and eventually chose to supplement their income by lodging boys in the house. maria's mother bronisåawa operated a prestigious warsaw boarding school for girls; she resigned from the position after maria was born. she died of tuberculosis in may 1878, when maria was ten years old. less than three years earlier, maria's oldest sibling, zofia, had died of typhus contracted from a boarder. maria's father was an atheist; her mother a devout catholic. the deaths of maria's mother and sister caused her to give up catholicism and become agnostic.

when she was ten years old, maria began attending the boarding school of j. sikorska; next she attended a ""gymnasium"" for girls, from which she graduated on 12 june 1883 with a gold medal. after a collapse, possibly due to depression, she spent the following year in the countryside with relatives of her father, and the next year with her father in warsaw, where she did some tutoring. unable to enroll in a regular institution of higher education because she was a woman, she and her sister bronisåawa became involved with the clandestine flying university (sometimes translated as ""floating university""), a polish patriotic institution of higher learning that admitted women students.

maria made an agreement with her sister, bronisåawa, that she would give her financial assistance during bronisåawa's medical studies in paris, in exchange for similar assistance two years later. in connection with this, maria took a position as governess: first as a home tutor in warsaw; then for two years as a governess in szczuki with a landed family, the å»orawskis, who were relatives of her father. while working for the latter family, she fell in love with their son, kazimierz å»orawski, a future eminent mathematician. his parents rejected the idea of his marrying the penniless relative, and kazimierz was unable to oppose them. maria's loss of the relationship with å»orawski was tragic for both. he soon earned a doctorate and pursued an academic career as a mathematician, becoming a professor and rector of krakã³w university. still, as an old man and a mathematics professor at the warsaw polytechnic, he would sit contemplatively before the statue of maria skåodowska which had been erected in 1935 before the radium institute that she had founded in 1932.

at the beginning of 1890, bronisåawaâwho a few months earlier had married kazimierz dåuski, a polish physician and social and political activistâinvited maria to join them in paris. maria declined because she could not afford the university tuition; it would take her a year and a half longer to gather the necessary funds. she was helped by her father, who was able to secure a more lucrative position again. all that time she continued to educate herself, reading books, exchanging letters, and being tutored herself. in early 1889 she returned home to her father in warsaw. she continued working as a governess, and remained there till late 1891. she tutored, studied at the flying university, and began her practical scientific training (1890â91) in a chemical laboratory at the museum of industry and agriculture at ""krakowskie przedmieåcie 66"", near warsaw's old town. the laboratory was run by her cousin jã³zef boguski, who had been an assistant in saint petersburg to the russian chemist dmitri mendeleev.

in late 1891, she left poland for france. in paris, maria (or marie, as she would be known in france) briefly found shelter with her sister and brother-in-law before renting a garret closer to the university, in the latin quarter, and proceeding with her studies of physics, chemistry, and mathematics at the university of paris, where she enrolled in late 1891. she subsisted on her meager resources, keeping herself warm during cold winters by wearing all the clothes she had. she focused so hard on her studies that she sometimes forgot to eat.

skåodowska studied during the day and tutored evenings, barely earning her keep. in 1893, she was awarded a degree in physics and began work in an industrial laboratory of professor gabriel lippmann. meanwhile, she continued studying at the university of paris, and with the aid of a fellowship she was able to earn a second degree in 1894.

skåodowska had begun her scientific career in paris with an investigation of the magnetic properties of various steels, commissioned by the society for the encouragement of national industry (""sociã©tã© d'encouragement pour l'industrie nationale"" ). that same year pierre curie entered her life; it was their mutual interest in natural sciences that drew them together. pierre curie was an instructor at the school of physics and chemistry, the ""ãcole supã©rieure de physique et de chimie industrielles de la ville de paris"" (espci). they were introduced by the polish physicist, professor jã³zef wierusz-kowalski, who had learned that she was looking for a larger laboratory space, something that wierusz-kowalski thought pierre curie had access to. though curie did not have a large laboratory, he was able to find some space for skåodowska where she was able to begin work.

their mutual passion for science brought them increasingly closer, and they began to develop feelings for one another. eventually pierre curie proposed marriage, but at first skåodowska did not accept as she was still planning to go back to her native country. curie, however, declared that he was ready to move with her to poland, even if it meant being reduced to teaching french. meanwhile, for the 1894 summer break, skåodowska returned to warsaw, where she visited her family. she was still laboring under the illusion that she would be able to work in her chosen field in poland, but she was denied a place at krakã³w university because she was a woman. a letter from pierre curie convinced her to return to paris to pursue a ph.d. at skåodowska's insistence, curie had written up his research on magnetism and received his own doctorate in march 1895; he was also promoted to professor at the school. a contemporary quip would call skåodowska ""pierre's biggest discovery."" on 26 july 1895 they were married in sceaux (seine); neither wanted a religious service. curie's dark blue outfit, worn instead of a bridal gown, would serve her for many years as a laboratory outfit. they shared two pastimes: long bicycle trips, and journeys abroad, which brought them even closer. in pierre, marie had found a new love, a partner, and a scientific collaborator on whom she could depend.

in 1895, wilhelm roentgen discovered the existence of x-rays, though the mechanism behind their production was not yet understood. in 1896, henri becquerel discovered that uranium salts emitted rays that resembled x-rays in their penetrating power. he demonstrated that this radiation, unlike phosphorescence, did not depend on an external source of energy but seemed to arise spontaneously from uranium itself. influenced by these two important discoveries, curie decided to look into uranium rays as a possible field of research for a thesis.

she used an innovative technique to investigate samples. fifteen years earlier, her husband and his brother had developed a version of the electrometer, a sensitive device for measuring electric charge. using her husband's electrometer, she discovered that uranium rays caused the air around a sample to conduct electricity. using this technique, her first result was the finding that the activity of the uranium compounds depended only on the quantity of uranium present. she hypothesized that the radiation was not the outcome of some interaction of molecules but must come from the atom itself. this hypothesis was an important step in disproving the assumption that atoms were indivisible.

in 1897, her daughter irã¨ne was born. to support her family, curie began teaching at the ãcole normale supã©rieure. the curies did not have a dedicated laboratory; most of their research was carried out in a converted shed next to the school of physics and chemistry. the shed, formerly a medical school dissecting room, was poorly ventilated and not even waterproof. they were unaware of the deleterious effects of radiation exposure attendant on their continued unprotected work with radioactive substances. the school did not sponsor her research, but she would receive subsidies from metallurgical and mining companies and from various organizations and governments.

curie's systematic studies included two uranium minerals, pitchblende and torbernite (also known as chalcolite). her electrometer showed that pitchblende was four times as active as uranium itself, and chalcolite twice as active. she concluded that, if her earlier results relating the quantity of uranium to its activity were correct, then these two minerals must contain small quantities of another substance that was far more active than uranium. she began a systematic search for additional substances that emit radiation, and by 1898 she discovered that the element thorium was also radioactive. pierre curie was increasingly intrigued by her work. by mid-1898 he was so invested in it that he decided to drop his work on crystals and to join her.

she was acutely aware of the importance of promptly publishing her discoveries and thus establishing her priority. had not becquerel, two years earlier, presented his discovery to the ""acadã©mie des sciences"" the day after he made it, credit for the discovery of radioactivity, and even a nobel prize, would instead have gone to silvanus thompson. curie chose the same rapid means of publication. her paper, giving a brief and simple account of her work, was presented for her to the ""acadã©mie"" on 12 april 1898 by her former professor, gabriel lippmann. even so, just as thompson had been beaten by becquerel, so curie was beaten in the race to tell of her discovery that thorium gives off rays in the same way as uranium; two months earlier, gerhard carl schmidt had published his own finding in berlin.

at that time, no one else in the world of physics had noticed what curie recorded in a sentence of her paper, describing how much greater were the activities of pitchblende and chalcolite than uranium itself: ""the fact is very remarkable, and leads to the belief that these minerals may contain an element which is much more active than uranium."" she later would recall how she felt ""a passionate desire to verify this hypothesis as rapidly as possible."" on 14 april 1898, the curies optimistically weighed out a 100-gram sample of pitchblende and ground it with a pestle and mortar. they did not realize at the time that what they were searching for was present in such minute quantities that they would eventually have to process tons of the ore.

in july 1898, curie and her husband published a joint paper announcing the existence of an element which they named ""polonium"", in honour of her native poland, which would for another twenty years remain partitioned among three empires (russian, austrian, and prussian). on 26 december 1898, the curies announced the existence of a second element, which they named ""radium"", from the latin word for ""ray"". in the course of their research, they also coined the word ""radioactivity"".

to prove their discoveries beyond any doubt, the curies sought to isolate polonium and radium in pure form. pitchblende is a complex mineral; the chemical separation of its constituents was an arduous task. the discovery of polonium had been relatively easy; chemically it resembles the element bismuth, and polonium was the only bismuth-like substance in the ore. radium, however, was more elusive; it is closely related chemically to barium, and pitchblende contains both elements. by 1898 the curies had obtained traces of radium, but appreciable quantities, uncontaminated with barium, were still beyond reach. the curies undertook the arduous task of separating out radium salt by differential crystallization. from a ton of pitchblende, one-tenth of a gram of radium chloride was separated in 1902. in 1910, she isolated pure radium metal. she never succeeded in isolating polonium, which has a half-life of only 138 days.

between 1898 and 1902, the curies published, jointly or separately, a total of 32 scientific papers, including one that announced that, when exposed to radium, diseased, tumor-forming cells were destroyed faster than healthy cells.

in 1900, curie became the first woman faculty member at the ãcole normale supã©rieure, and her husband joined the faculty of the university of paris. in 1902 she visited poland on the occasion of her father's death.

in june 1903, supervised by gabriel lippmann, curie was awarded her doctorate from the university of paris. that month the couple were invited to the royal institution in london to give a speech on radioactivity; being a woman, she was prevented from speaking, and pierre curie alone was allowed to. meanwhile, a new industry began developing, based on radium. the curies did not patent their discovery and benefited little from this increasingly profitable business.

in december 1903, the royal swedish academy of sciences awarded pierre curie, marie curie, and henri becquerel the nobel prize in physics, ""in recognition of the extraordinary services they have rendered by their joint researches on the radiation phenomena discovered by professor henri becquerel."" at first the committee had intended to honor only pierre curie and henri becquerel, but a committee member and advocate for women scientists, swedish mathematician magnus goesta mittag-leffler, alerted pierre to the situation, and after his complaint, marie's name was added to the nomination. marie curie was the first woman to be awarded a nobel prize.

curie and her husband declined to go to stockholm to receive the prize in person; they were too busy with their work, and pierre curie, who disliked public ceremonies, was feeling increasingly ill. as nobel laureates were required to deliver a lecture, the curies finally undertook the trip in 1905. the award money allowed the curies to hire their first laboratory assistant. following the award of the nobel prize, and galvanized by an offer from the university of geneva, which offered pierre curie a position, the university of paris gave him a professorship and the chair of physics, although the curies still did not have a proper laboratory. upon pierre curie's complaint, the university of paris relented and agreed to furnish a new laboratory, but it would not be ready until 1906.

in december 1904, curie gave birth to their second daughter, ãve. she hired polish governesses to teach her daughters her native language, and sent or took them on visits to poland.

on 19 april 1906, pierre curie was killed in a road accident. walking across the rue dauphine in heavy rain, he was struck by a horse-drawn vehicle and fell under its wheels, causing his skull to fracture. curie was devastated by her husband's death. on 13 may 1906 the physics department of the university of paris decided to retain the chair that had been created for her late husband and to offer it to marie. she accepted it, hoping to create a world-class laboratory as a tribute to her husband pierre. she was the first woman to become a professor at the university of paris.

curie's quest to create a new laboratory did not end with the university of paris, however. in her later years, she headed the radium institute (""institut du radium"", now curie institute, ""institut curie""), a radioactivity laboratory created for her by the pasteur institute and the university of paris. the initiative for creating the radium institute had come in 1909 from pierre paul ãmile roux, director of the pasteur institute, who had been disappointed that the university of paris was not giving curie a proper laboratory and had suggested that she move to the pasteur institute. only then, with the threat of curie leaving, did the university of paris relent, and eventually the curie pavilion became a joint initiative of the university of paris and the pasteur institute.

in 1910 curie succeeded in isolating radium; she also defined an international standard for radioactive emissions that was eventually named for her and pierre: the curie. nevertheless, in 1911 the french academy of sciences failed, by one or two votes, to elect her to membership in the academy. elected instead was ãdouard branly, an inventor who had helped guglielmo marconi develop the wireless telegraph. it was only over half a century later, in 1962, that a doctoral student of curie's, marguerite perey, became the first woman elected to membership in the academy.

despite curie's fame as a scientist working for france, the public's attitude tended toward xenophobiaâthe same that had led to the dreyfus affairâwhich also fueled false speculation that curie was jewish. during the french academy of sciences elections, she was vilified by the right-wing press as a foreigner and atheist. her daughter later remarked on the french press' hypocrisy in portraying curie as an unworthy foreigner when she was nominated for a french honor, but portraying her as a french heroine when she received foreign honors such as her nobel prizes.

in 1911, it was revealed that curie was involved in a year long affair with physicist paul langevin, a former student of pierre curie's, a married man who was estranged from his wife. this resulted in a press scandal that was exploited by her academic opponents. curie (then in her mid-40s) was five years older than langevin and was misrepresented in the tabloids as a foreign jewish home-wrecker. when the scandal broke, she was away at a conference in belgium; on her return, she found an angry mob in front of her house and had to seek refuge, with her daughters, in the home of her friend, camille marbo.

international recognition for her work had been growing to new heights, and the royal swedish academy of sciences, overcoming opposition prompted by the langevin scandal, honored her a second time, with the 1911 nobel prize in chemistry. this award was ""in recognition of her services to the advancement of chemistry by the discovery of the elements radium and polonium, by the isolation of radium and the study of the nature and compounds of this remarkable element."" she was the first person to win or share two nobel prizes, and remains alone with linus pauling as nobel laureates in two fields each. a delegation of celebrated polish men of learning, headed by novelist henryk sienkiewicz, encouraged her to return to poland and continue her research in her native country. curie's second nobel prize enabled her to persuade the french government into supporting the radium institute, built in 1914, where research was conducted in chemistry, physics, and medicine. a month after accepting her 1911 nobel prize, she was hospitalised with depression and a kidney ailment. for most of 1912 she avoided public life but did spend time in england with her friend and fellow physicist, hertha ayrton. she returned to her laboratory only in december, after a break of about 14 months.

in 1912, the warsaw scientific society offered her the directorship of a new laboratory in warsaw but she declined, focusing on the developing radium institute to be completed in august 1914, and on a new street named rue pierre-curie. she was appointed director of the curie laboratory in the radium institute of the university of paris, founded in 1914. she visited poland in 1913 and was welcomed in warsaw but the visit was mostly ignored by the russian authorities. the institute's development was interrupted by the coming war, as most researchers were drafted into the french army, and it fully resumed its activities in 1919.

during world war i, curie recognised that wounded soldiers were best served if operated upon as soon as possible. she saw a need for field radiological centres near the front lines to assist battlefield surgeons. after a quick study of radiology, anatomy, and automotive mechanics she procured x-ray equipment, vehicles, auxiliary generators, and developed mobile radiography units, which came to be popularly known as ""petites curies"" (""little curies""). she became the director of the red cross radiology service and set up france's first military radiology centre, operational by late 1914. assisted at first by a military doctor and by her 17-year-old daughter irã¨ne, curie directed the installation of 20 mobile radiological vehicles and another 200 radiological units at field hospitals in the first year of the war. later, she began training other women as aides.

in 1915, curie produced hollow needles containing ""radium emanation"", a colorless, radioactive gas given off by radium, later identified as radon, to be used for sterilizing infected tissue. she provided the radium from her own one-gram supply. it is estimated that over a million wounded soldiers were treated with her x-ray units. busy with this work, she carried out very little scientific research during that period. in spite of all her humanitarian contributions to the french war effort, curie never received any formal recognition of it from the french government.

also, promptly after the war started, she attempted to donate her gold nobel prize medals to the war effort but the french national bank refused to accept them. she did buy war bonds, using her nobel prize money. she said:i am going to give up the little gold i possess. i shall add to this the scientific medals, which are quite useless to me. there is something else: by sheer laziness i had allowed the money for my second nobel prize to remain in stockholm in swedish crowns. this is the chief part of what we possess. i should like to bring it back here and invest it in war loans. the state needs it. only, i have no illusions: this money will probably be lost. she was also an active member in committees of polonia in france dedicated to the polish cause. after the war, she summarized her wartime experiences in a book, ""radiology in war"" (1919).

in 1920, for the 25th anniversary of the discovery of radium, the french government established a stipend for her; its previous recipient was louis pasteur (1822â95). in 1921, she was welcomed triumphantly when she toured the united states to raise funds for research on radium. mrs. william brown meloney, after interviewing curie, created a ""marie curie radium fund"" and raised money to buy radium, publicising her trip.

in 1921, u.s. president warren g. harding received her at the white house to present her with the 1â gram of radium collected in the united states, and the first lady praised her as an example of a professional achiever who was also a supportive wife. before the meeting, recognising her growing fame abroad, and embarrassed by the fact that she had no french official distinctions to wear in public, the french government offered her a legion of honour award, but she refused. in 1922 she became a fellow of the french academy of medicine. she also travelled to other countries, appearing publicly and giving lectures in belgium, brazil, spain, and czechoslovakia.

led by curie, the institute produced four more nobel prize winners, including her daughter irã¨ne joliot-curie and her son-in-law, frã©dã©ric joliot-curie. eventually it became one of the world's four major radioactivity-research laboratories, the others being the cavendish laboratory, with ernest rutherford; the institute for radium research, vienna, with stefan meyer; and the kaiser wilhelm institute for chemistry, with otto hahn and lise meitner.

in august 1922 marie curie became a member of the league of nations' newly created international committee on intellectual cooperation. she sat on the committee until 1934 and contributed to league of nations scientific coordination with other prominent researchers such as albert einstein, hendrik lorentz, and henri bergson. in 1923 she wrote a biography of her late husband, titled ""pierre curie"". in 1925 she visited poland to participate in a ceremony laying the foundations for warsaw's radium institute. her second american tour, in 1929, succeeded in equipping the warsaw radium institute with radium; the institute opened in 1932, with her sister bronisåawa its director. these distractions from her scientific labours, and the attendant publicity, caused her much discomfort but provided resources for her work. in 1930 she was elected to the international atomic weights committee, on which she served until her death.

curie visited poland for the last time in early 1934. a few months later, on 4 july 1934, she died at the sancellemoz sanatorium in passy, haute-savoie, from aplastic anemia believed to have been contracted from her long-term exposure to radiation.

the damaging effects of ionising radiation were not known at the time of her work, which had been carried out without the safety measures later developed. she had carried test tubes containing radioactive isotopes in her pocket, and she stored them in her desk drawer, remarking on the faint light that the substances gave off in the dark. curie was also exposed to x-rays from unshielded equipment while serving as a radiologist in field hospitals during the war. although her many decades of exposure to radiation caused chronic illnesses (including near-blindness due to cataracts) and ultimately her death, she never really acknowledged the health risks of radiation exposure.

she was interred at the cemetery in sceaux, alongside her husband pierre. sixty years later, in 1995, in honour of their achievements, the remains of both were transferred to the panthã©on, paris. she became the first woman to be honoured with interment in the panthã©on on her own merits.

because of their levels of radioactive contamination, her papers from the 1890s are considered too dangerous to handle. even her cookbook is highly radioactive. her papers are kept in lead-lined boxes, and those who wish to consult them must wear protective clothing. in her last year, she worked on a book, ""radioactivity"", which was published posthumously in 1935.

the physical and societal aspects of the curies' work contributed to shaping the world of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. cornell university professor williams observes:

if curie's work helped overturn established ideas in physics and chemistry, it has had an equally profound effect in the societal sphere. to attain her scientific achievements, she had to overcome barriers, in both her native and her adoptive country, that were placed in her way because she was a woman. this aspect of her life and career is highlighted in franã§oise giroud's ""marie curie: a life"", which emphasizes curie's role as a feminist precursor.

she was known for her honesty and moderate lifestyle. having received a small scholarship in 1893, she returned it in 1897 as soon as she began earning her keep. she gave much of her first nobel prize money to friends, family, students, and research associates. in an unusual decision, curie intentionally refrained from patenting the radium-isolation process, so that the scientific community could do research unhindered. she insisted that monetary gifts and awards be given to the scientific institutions she was affiliated with rather than to her. she and her husband often refused awards and medals. albert einstein reportedly remarked that she was probably the only person who could not be corrupted by fame.

as one of the most famous women scientists to date, marie curie has become an icon in the scientific world and has received tributes from across the globe, even in the realm of pop culture. in a 2009 poll carried out by ""new scientist"", she was voted the ""most inspirational woman in science"". curie received 25.1 per cent of all votes cast, nearly twice as many as second-place rosalind franklin (14.2 per cent).

poland and france declared 2011 the year of marie curie, and the united nations declared that this would be the international year of chemistry. an artistic installation celebrating ""madame curie"" filled the jacobs gallery at san diego's museum of contemporary art. on 7 november, google celebrated the anniversary of her birth with a special google doodle. on 10 december, the new york academy of sciences celebrated the centenary of marie curie's second nobel prize in the presence of princess madeleine of sweden.

marie curie was the first woman to win a nobel prize, the first person to win two nobel prizes, the only woman to win in two fields, and the only person to win in multiple sciences. awards that she received include:

marie curie's 1898 publication with her husband and their collaborator gustave bã©mont for their discovery of radium and polonium was honored by a citation for chemical breakthrough award from the division of history of chemistry of the american chemical society presented to the espci paris (ecole supã©rieure de physique et de chimie industrielles de la ville de paris) in 2015.

in 1995, she became the first woman to be entombed on her own merits in the panthã©on, paris. the curie (symbol ci), a unit of radioactivity, is named in honour of her and pierre curie (although the commission which agreed on the name never clearly stated whether the standard was named after pierre, marie or both of them). the element with atomic number 96 was named curium. three radioactive minerals are also named after the curies: curite, sklodowskite, and cuprosklodowskite. she received numerous honorary degrees from universities across the world. the marie skåodowska-curie actions fellowship program of the european union for young scientists wishing to work in a foreign country is named after her. in poland, she had received honorary doctorates from the lwã³w polytechnic (1912),poznaå university (1922), krakã³w's jagiellonian university (1924), and the warsaw polytechnic (1926). in 1921, in the u.s., she was awarded membership in the iota sigma pi women scientists' society.

her name is included on the ""monument to the x-ray and radium martyrs of all nations"", erected in hamburg, germany in 1936.

numerous locations around the world are named after her. in 2007, a metro station in paris was renamed to honour both of the curies. polish nuclear research reactor maria is named after her. the 7000 curie asteroid is also named after her. a klm mcdonnell douglas md-11 (registration ph-kcc) is named in her honour.

several institutions bear her name, starting with the two curie institutes: the maria skåodowskaâcurie institute of oncology, in warsaw and the ""institut curie"" in paris. she is the patron of maria curie-skåodowska university, in lublin, founded in 1944; and of pierre and marie curie university (paris vi), france's pre-eminent science university. in britain, marie curie cancer care was organized in 1948 to care for the terminally ill.

two museums are devoted to marie curie. in 1967, the maria skåodowska-curie museum was established in warsaw's ""new town"", at her birthplace on ""ulica freta"" (freta street). her paris laboratory is preserved as the musã©e curie, open since 1992.

several works of art bear her likeness. in 1935, michalina moåcicka, wife of polish president ignacy moåcicki, unveiled a statue of marie curie before warsaw's radium institute. during the 1944 second world war warsaw uprising against the nazi german occupation, the monument was damaged by gunfire; after the war it was decided to leave the bullet marks on the statue and its pedestal. in 1955 jozef mazur created a stained glass panel of her, the maria skåodowska-curie medallion, featured in the university at buffalo polish room.

a number of biographies are devoted to her. in 1938 her daughter, ãve curie, published ""madame curie"". in 1987 franã§oise giroud wrote ""marie curie: a life"". in 2005 barbara goldsmith wrote ""obsessive genius: the inner world of marie curie"". in 2011 lauren redniss published ""radioactive: marie and pierre curie, a tale of love and fallout"".

marie curie has been the subject of several biographical films:


curie is the subject of the 2013 play ""false assumptions"" by lawrence aronovitch, in which the ghosts of three other women scientists observe events in her life. curie has also been portrayed by susan marie frontczak in her play ""manya: the living history of marie curie"", a one-woman show performed in 30 us states and nine countries, by 2014.

curie's likeness also has appeared on banknotes, stamps and coins around the world. she was featured on the polish late-1980s 20,000-""zåoty"" banknote as well as on the last french 500-franc note, before the franc was replaced by the euro. curie-themed postage stamps from mali, the republic of togo, zambia, and the republic of guinea actually show a picture of susan marie frontczak portraying curie in a 2001 picture by paul schroeder.

in 2011, on the centenary of marie curie's second nobel prize, an allegorical mural was painted on the faã§ade of her warsaw birthplace. it depicts an infant maria skåodowska holding a test tube from which emanate the elements that she would discover as an adult: polonium and radium. also in 2011, a new warsaw bridge over the vistula was named in her honor.
"
dhirubhai ambani,"
dhirajlal hirachand ambani, popularly known as dhirubhai ambani (28 december 1932 â 6 july 2002) was an indian business tycoon who founded reliance industries in bombay and appeared in ""the sunday times"" top 50 businessmen in asia. ambani took reliance public in 1977 and was worth $25.6 billion upon his death on 6 july 2002. in 2016, he was honored posthumously with the padma vibhushan, india's second highest civilian honor for his contributions to trade and industry.

dhirubhai ambani was one of the sons of hirachand gordhanbhai ambani, a village school teacher belonging to the modh community and jamnaben ambani and was born in chorwad, junagadh district, gujarat. dhirubhai married kokila, and they had four children; mukesh ambani, anil ambani, nina bhadrashyam kothari and dipti dattaraj salgaocar. he migrated to the then british colony of aden at age 17 where his brother was working. he initially served as a clerk at a. besse & co., which then was the largest transcontinental trading firm east of suez. he worked as a employer in yemen, then came to india with â¹50000 and started a textile trading company in 1958..

ambani returned to india and started ""majin"" in partnership with champaklal damani, his second cousin, who lived with him in yemen. majin was to import polyester yarn and export spices to yemen. the first office of the reliance commercial corporation was set up at the narsinatha street in masjid bunder. it was a room with a telephone, one table and three chairs. initially, they had two assistants to help them with their business. during this period, ambani and his family stayed in a two-bedroom apartment at the jai hind estate in bhuleshwar, mumbai. in 1965, champaklal damani and dhirubhai ambani ended their partnership and ambani started on his own. it is believed that both had different temperaments and a different take on how to conduct business. while damani was a cautious trader and did not believe in building yarn inventories, ambani was a known risk-taker and believed in building inventories to increase profit. in 1966 he formed reliance commercial corporation which later became reliance industries on 08 may 1973.

extensive marketing of the brand in the interiors of india made it a household name. franchise retail outlets were started and they sold the ""only vimal"" brand of textiles. in the year 1975, a technical team from the world bank visited the 'reliance textiles' manufacturing unit.

in 1988, reliance industries came up against a rights issue regarding partly convertible debentures. it was rumoured that the company was making all efforts to ensure that their stock prices did not slide an inch. sensing an opportunity, the bear cartel, a group of stock brokers from calcutta, started to short sell the shares of reliance. to counter this, a group of stock brokers until recently referred to as ""friends of reliance"" started to buy the short sold shares of reliance industries on the bombay stock exchange.

the bear cartel was acting on the belief that the bulls would be short of cash to complete the transactions and would be ready for settlement under the ""badla"" trading system operative in the bombay stock exchange. the bulls kept buying and a price of 152 per share was maintained until the day of settlement. on the day of settlement, the bear cartel was taken aback when the bulls demanded a physical delivery of shares. to complete the transaction, much money was provided to the stock brokers who had bought shares of reliance, by dhirubhai ambani. in the case of non-settlement, the bulls demanded an ""unbadla"", or penalty sum, of 35 per share. with this, the demand increased and the shares of reliance shot above 180 in minutes. the settlement caused an enormous uproar in the market.

to find a solution to this situation, the bombay stock exchange was closed for three business days. authorities from the bombay stock exchange (bse) intervened in the matter and brought down the ""unbadla"" rate to 2 with a stipulation that the bear cartel had to deliver the shares within the next few days. the bear cartel bought shares of reliance from the market at higher price levels and it was also learnt that dhirubhai ambani himself supplied those shares to the bear cartel and earned a healthy profit out of the bear cartel's adventure.

after this incident, many questions were raised by his detractors and the press. not many people were able to understand how a yarn trader until a few years ago was able to get in such a huge amount of cash flow during a crisis period. the answer to this was provided by the then finance minister, pranab mukherjee in the parliament. he informed the house that a non-resident indian had invested up to 220 million in reliance during 1982â83. these investments were routed through many companies like crocodile, lota and fiasco. these companies were primarily registered in isle of man. all the promoters or owners of these companies had a common surname shah. an investigation by the reserve bank of india in the incident did not find any unethical or illegal acts or transactions committed by reliance or its promoters.

ambani was admitted to the breach candy hospital in mumbai on 24 june 2002 after he suffered a major stroke. it was his second stroke, the first had occurred in february 1986 and had paralyzed his right hand. he was in a coma for more than a week and a number of doctors were consulted. he died on 6 july 2002.

following his first stroke in 1986, ambani handed over control of reliance to his sons, mukesh and anil. in november 2004, mukesh in an interview admitted to having differences with anil over ownership issues. he also said that the differences ""are in the private domain"".
after the death of dhirubhai ambani, the group was split into reliance industries limited headed by mukesh, and reliance anil dhirubhai ambani group headed by anil.

as of 2017, the company has more than 250,000 employees. in 2012, reliance industries was one of the two indian companies to be ranked among the top 100 in the fortune 500 list of the world's largest companies by revenue.

in 1988 an unauthorized biography of dhirubhai ambani, by hamish mcdonald with the title ""the polyester prince"", outlined all his political and business conquests. the book was not published in india because the ambanis threatened legal action; an updated version went on sale under the title ""ambani and sons"" in 2010, and there has been no action against the publisher so far.

a hindi film said to be loosely inspired by the life of dhirubhai ambani was released on 12 january 2007. ""guru"", directed by filmmaker mani ratnam, cinematography by rajiv menon and music by a.r.rahman shows the struggle of a man striving to make his mark in the indian business world with a fictional shakti group of industries.

ms dhoni,"
mahendra singh dhoni ( born 7 july 1981), commonly known as ms dhoni, is an indian international cricketer who captained the indian national team in limited-overs formats from 2007 to 2016 and in test cricket from 2008 to 2014. under his captaincy, india won the 2007 icc world twenty20, the 2010 and 2016 asia cups, the 2011 icc cricket world cup and the 2013 icc champions trophy. a right-handed middle-order batsman and wicket-keeper, dhoni is one of the highest run scorers in one day internationals (odis) with more than 10,000 runs scored and is considered an effective ""finisher"" in limited-overs formats. he is also regarded by some as one of the best wicket-keepers and captain in modern limited-overs international cricket.

he made his odi debut in december 2004 against bangladesh, and played his first test a year later against sri lanka. dhoni has been the recipient of many awards, including the icc odi player of the year award in 2008 and 2009 (the first player to win the award twice), the rajiv gandhi khel ratna award in 2007, the padma shri, india's fourth highest civilian honour, in 2009 and the padma bhushan, india's third highest civilian honour, in 2018. he was named as the captain of the icc world test xi in 2009, 2010 and 2013. he has also been selected a record 8 times in icc world odi xi teams, 5 times as captain. the indian territorial army conferred the honorary rank of lieutenant colonel to dhoni on 1 november 2011. he is the second indian cricketer after kapil dev to receive this honour.

dhoni also holds numerous captaincy records such as the most wins by an indian captain in tests, odis and t20is, and most back-to-back wins by an indian captain in odis. he took over the odi captaincy from rahul dravid in 2007 and led the team to its first-ever bilateral odi series wins in sri lanka and new zealand. in june 2013, when india defeated england in the final of the champions trophy in england, dhoni became the first captain to win all three icc limited-overs trophies (world cup, champions trophy and the world twenty20). after taking up the test captaincy in 2008, he led the team to series wins in new zealand and the west indies, and the border-gavaskar trophy in 2008, 2010 and 2013. in 2009, dhoni also led the indian team to number one position for the first time in the icc test rankings.

in 2013, under his captaincy, india became the first team in more than 40 years to whitewash australia in a test series. in the indian premier league, he captained the chennai super kings to victory at the 2010, 2011 and 2018 seasons, along with wins in the 2010 and 2014 editions of champions league twenty20. in 2011, ""time"" magazine included dhoni in its annual time 100 list as one of the ""most influential people in the world."" dhoni holds the post of vice-president of india cements ltd., after resigning from air india. india cements is the owner of the ipl team chennai super kings, and dhoni has been its captain since the first ipl season. he announced his retirement from tests on 30 december 2014.

in 2012, sportspro rated dhoni as the sixteenth most marketable athlete in the world. dhoni is the co-owner of indian super league team chennaiyin fc. in june 2015, ""forbes"" ranked dhoni at 23rd in the list of highest paid athletes in the world, estimating his earnings at us$31 million. in 2016, a biopic """" was made about him.

dhoni was born in ranchi, bihar (now in jharkhand), and he identifies as a hindu rajput. his paternal village lwali is in the lamgara block of the almora district of uttarakhand. dhoni's parents moved from uttarakhand to ranchi, where his father pan singh worked in junior management positions in mecon. dhoni has a sister jayanti gupta and a brother narendra singh dhoni. dhoni is a fan of adam gilchrist, and his childhood idols were cricket teammate sachin tendulkar, bollywood actor amitabh bachchan and singer lata mangeshkar

dhoni studied at dav jawahar vidya mandir, shyamali, ranchi, jharkhand where he initially excelled in badminton and football and was selected at district and club level in these sports. dhoni was a goalkeeper for his football team and was sent to play cricket for a local cricket club by his football coach. though he had not played cricket, dhoni impressed with his wicket-keeping skills and became the regular wicketkeeper at the commando cricket club (1995â1998). based on his performance at club cricket, he was picked for the 1997/98 season vinoo mankad trophy under-16 championship and he performed well. dhoni focused on cricket after his 10th standard. dhoni was a travelling ticket examiner (tte) at kharagpur railway station from 2001 to 2003, under south eastern railway in midnapore (w), a district in west bengal. his colleagues remember him as a very honest, straightforward employee of the indian railways. but he also had a mischievous side to his personality. once, while staying at the railway quarters, dhoni and a couple of his friends covered themselves in white bedsheets and walked around in the complex late in the night. the night guards were fooled into believing that there were ghosts moving around in the complex. the story made big news on the next day.

in 1998, dhoni was selected by deval sahay to play for the central coal fields limited (ccl) team. till 1998 dhoni, who was in class 12th in school, had played only school cricket and club cricket and no professional cricket. one of the famous episodes, when dhoni used to play for ccl, was when deval sahay used to gift him rs 50 for each six that he hit in sheesh mahal tournament cricket matches. playing for ccl, he got a chance to bat up the order. he grabbed the opportunity and scored centuries and helped ccl move to the a division . deval sahay impressed by his hard-hitting shots and dedication, used his contacts in bihar cricket association to push for his selection in the bihar team. deval sahay, an ex bihar cricket association vice-president, was the ranchi district cricket president at that time and was instrumental in pushing dhoni to the big stage of ranchi team, junior bihar cricket team and eventually senior bihar ranji team for the 1999â2000 season. within 1 year, dhoni moved from playing in ccl to the bihar ranji team . dhoni has credited deval sahay for instilling discipline in him . dhoni was included in the bihar u-19 squad for the 1998â99 season and scored 176 runs in 5 matches (7 innings) as the team finished fourth in the group of six and did not make it to the quarter-finals. dhoni was not picked for the east zone u-19 squad (ck nayudu trophy) or rest of india squad (ma chidambaram trophy and vinoo mankad trophy). bihar u-19 cricket team advanced to the finals of 1999â2000 cooch behar trophy, where dhoni made 84 to help bihar post a total of 357. bihar's efforts were dwarfed by punjab u-19s' 839 with dhoni's future national squad teammate yuvraj singh making 358. dhoni's contribution in the tournament included 488 runs (9 matches, 12 innings), 5 fifties, 17 catches and 7 stumpings. dhoni made it to the east zone u-19 squad for the ck nayudu trophy but scored only 97 runs in four matches, as east zone lost all four matches and finished last in the tournament.

dhoni made his ranji trophy debut for bihar in the 1999â2000 season, as an eighteen-year-old. he made a half century in his debut match scoring 68* in the second innings against assam cricket team. dhoni finished the season with 283 runs in 5 matches. dhoni scored his maiden first-class century while playing for bihar against bengal in the 2000/01 season, in a losing cause. apart from this century, his performance in the 2000/01 season did not include another score over fifty and in the 2001/02 season, he scored just five fifties in four ranji matches.

dhoni's performance in the 2002â03 season included three half-centuries in the ranji trophy and a couple of half-centuries in the deodhar trophy, as he started gaining recognition for his lower-order contribution as well as hard-hitting batting style. in the 2003/04 season, dhoni scored a century (128*) against assam in the first match of the ranji odi tournament. dhoni was part of the east zone squad that won the deodhar trophy 2003â2004 season and contributed with 244 runs in 4 matches, including a century (114) against central zone.

in the duleep trophy finals, dhoni was picked over international cricketer deep dasgupta to represent east zone. he scored a fighting half-century in the second innings in a losing cause. dhoni's talent was discovered via the bcci's small-town talent-spotting initiative trdw. dhoni was discovered by trdo prakash poddar, captain of bengal in the 1960s, when he saw dhoni play for jharkhand at a match in jamshedpur in 2003, and sent a report to the national cricket academy.

he was recognised for his efforts in the 2003/04 season, especially in the one day format and was picked for the india a squad for a tour of zimbabwe and kenya. against the zimbabwe xi in harare sports club, dhoni had his best wicket-keeping effort with 7 catches and 4 stumpings in the match. in the tri-nation tournament involving kenya, india a and pakistan a, dhoni helped india a chase down their target of 223 against pakistan a with a half-century. continuing his good performance, he scored back to back centuries â 120 and 119* â against the same team. dhoni scored 362 runs in 6 innings at an average of 72.40 and his performance in the series received attention from the then indian captain â sourav ganguly and ravi shastri, amongst others.

the indian odi team in the early 2000s saw rahul dravid as the wicket-keeper to ensure that the wicket-keeper spot didn't lack in batting talent. the team also saw the entry of wicket-keeper/batsmen from the junior ranks, with talents like parthiv patel and dinesh karthik (both india u-19 captains) named in the test squads. with dhoni making a mark in the india a squad, he was picked in the odi squad for the bangladesh tour in 2004/05. dhoni did not have a great start to his odi career, getting run out for a duck on debut. in spite of an average series against bangladesh, dhoni was picked for the pakistan odi series.

in the second match of the series, dhoni, in his fifth one-day international, scored 148 in visakhapatnam off only 123 deliveries. dhoni's 148 surpassed the earlier record for the highest score by an indian wicket-keeper, a record that he would re-write before the end of the year.

dhoni had few batting opportunities in the first two games of the sri lankan bilateral odi series (octoberânovember 2005) and was promoted to no. 3 in the third odi at sawai mansingh stadium (jaipur). sri lanka had set india a target of 299 after a kumar sangakkara century and, in reply, india lost tendulkar early. dhoni was promoted to accelerate the scoring and ended the game with an unbeaten 183 off 145 balls, winning the game for india. the innings was described in wisden almanack (2006) as 'uninhibited, yet anything but crude'. the innings set various records including the highest individual score in odi cricket in the second innings, a record only broken after seven years by shane watson. dhoni ended the series with the highest run aggregate (346) and was awarded the man of the series award for his efforts. in december 2005, dhoni was rewarded a b-grade contract by the bcci.
india scored 328 in 50 overs with dhoni contributing 68 in their first match of 2006 against pakistan. however, the team finished poorly scoring just 43 runs in the last eight overs and lost the match due to duckworth-lewis method. in the third match of the series, dhoni came in with india in a precarious situation and scored 72 runs off just 46 balls that included 13 boundaries to help india take a 2â1 lead in the series. the final match of the series had a repeat performance as dhoni scored 77 runs off 56 balls to enable india win the series 4â1. due to his consistent odi performances, dhoni overtook ricky ponting as number one in the icc odi rankings for batsmen on 20 april 2006 becoming the fastest batsman to do so, in 42 innings. his reign lasted just a week as adam gilchrist's performance against bangladesh moved him to the top spot.

two cancelled series in sri lanka, one due to the withdrawal of south africa from the unitech cup due to security concerns and the replacement three-match odi bilateral series against sri lanka washed due to rain, was india's prelude to another disappointing tournament â dlf cup 2006-07. dhoni scored 43 runs as the team lost twice in three games and did not qualify for the finals. india's lack of preparation showed in the 2006 icc champions trophy as they lost to west indies and australia, though dhoni scored a half-century against west indies. the story of the odi series in south africa was the same for both dhoni and india as dhoni scored 139 runs in 4 matches and india lost the series 4â0. from the start of the west indies odi series, dhoni had played 16 matches, hit just two fifties and averaged 25.93. dhoni received criticism on his wicket-keeping technique from former wicket-keeper syed kirmani. yet, for his performances in 2006, he was named in the world odi xi by the icc.

preparations for the 2007 cricket world cup improved as india recorded identical 3â1 victories over west indies and sri lanka and dhoni had averages in excess of 100 in both these series.

india unexpectedly crashed out of the world cup after losses to bangladesh and sri lanka in the group stage. dhoni was out for a duck in both these matches and scored just 29 runs in the tournament. after the loss to bangladesh in 2007 cricket world cup, the house that dhoni was constructing in his home-town ranchi was vandalised and damaged by political activists of jmm. the local police arranged for security for his family as india exited the world cup in the first round.

dhoni put his disappointing performances in the world cup behind him by scoring 91* against bangladesh, after india were left in a tight spot earlier in the run-chase. dhoni was declared the man of the match for his performance, his fourth in odi cricket. he was also later adjudged the man of the series after the third game of the series was washed away. dhoni had a good afro-asia cup, scoring 174 runs in 3 matches at an average of 87.00, with a blitzkrieg 139 not out off 97 balls, a man of the match innings, in the third odi.

dhoni was named vice-captain of the odi team for the series against south africa in ireland and the subsequent india-england seven-match odi series. dhoni, who received a 'b' grade contract in december 2005, was awarded an 'a' grade contract in june 2007. he was also elected as the captain of the indian squad for the world twenty20 in september 2007. on 2 september 2007, dhoni equalled his idol adam gilchrist's international record for the most dismissals in an innings in odi by catching five english players and stumping one.

dhoni topped the icc odi batsman rankings for several months in 2009. michael hussey from australia replaced him at the top spot at the beginning of 2010.

dhoni had an excellent year in odis in 2009, scoring 1198 runs in just 24 innings, at an astonishing average of 70.43. dhoni was also the joint top-scorer in odis in 2009 along with ricky ponting, but the latter having played 30 innings. for his performances in 2009, he was named as captain and wicket keeper of the world odi xi by the icc. he was also named as wicket keeper in the world odi xi by the icc for 2010.

the icc cricket world cup 2011 kicked off in the subcontinent and dhoni-led india were seen as ""favorites"". although dhoni didn't had a good show with the bat averaging just 30.0 in seven innings and managing 150 runs, india reached the finals with victories over australia and pakistan in quarter-finals and semi-finals, respectively. chasing a target of 275 in the final against sri lanka, dhoni rescued his team alongside gautam gambhir, and later yuvraj singh to help india lift their second world cup title since 1983. he scored 91 not out, finishing the game with a historical six and claiming the man of the match award.

for his performances in 2011, he was named as captain and wicket keeper of the world odi xi by the icc. he was also named in the world odi xi by cricinfo.

in 2012, pakistan toured india for a bilateral series for the first time in five years. in the three-match odi series, dhoni top scored for india in all three innings; however india lost the series 1-2. in the first odi at chennai, he helped india recover from 29/5 to help post a total of 227 in 50 overs. playing a knock of 113 not out, he had a record partnership with ravichandran ashwin, although in a losing cause.

for his performances in 2012, he was named in as captain and wicket keeper of the world odi xi by the icc.

winning the 2013 icc champions trophy, dhoni became the first and only captain in international cricket to claim all icc trophies. in the rain-shortened final against england, he was out for a duck and thus ending up the tournament with 27 runs from two innings. however, his field placements and tactics came handy, the team was successful beating the opposition by five runs (d/l method). he was also named as captain and wicket keeper of the 'team of the tournament' by the icc.

in november 2013, dhoni became the second india batsman after sachin tendulkar to aggregate 1,000 or more odi-runs against australia.

for his performances in 2013, he was named as captain and wicket keeper of the world odi xi by the icc. he was also named in the odi xi by cricinfo for his performances in 2013.

india toured south africa and new zealand in the 2013-14 season and ending up losing both series, 0-2 and 0-4 respectively. against south africa, dhoni managed 84 runs at an average of 48.0, including one half-century. against new zealand, he managed 272 runs which included three consecutive 50-plus scores. in the third match of the series, his knock of 50 helped india tie the match and eventually avoiding a series whitewash. meanwhile, he scored his 8000th run in odi cricket on the tour.

india won the away odi series in england in 2014 by 3-1 and series against west indies in india by 2-1 margin. dhoni had a good performance with the bat scoring a half century in each of the series.

for his performances in 2014, he was named as captain and wicket keeper of the world odi xi by the icc.

india's preparation, going into the tournament, looked poor as india failed badly in the carlton mid triangular series in australia, failing to win a single match. dhoni himself managed just 70 runs from three innings averaging 23.34.

during the 2015 cricket world cup, dhoni became the first indian captain to win all group stages matches in such a tournament. india achieved wins against arch-rivals pakistan, south africa (whom they hadn't beaten before in a world cup game), the united arab emirates, the west indies, ireland and zimbabwe. in the match against zimbabwe at eden park, he made 85 not out chasing 288 and had an unbeaten partnership of 195 with suresh raina. this is the highest score by an indian captain on new zealand soil. beating bangladesh in the quarter finals, he became the third overall and the first non-australian captain to win 100 odi matches. in an unsuccessful effort against eventual champions australia in the semi finals, he made 65 as india were unable to defend their title.

dhoni stepped down as captain of india in the limited over formats in january 2017, just ahead of the odi series at home against england. in the second game of the series, he scored 134 off 122 balls, that included a 256-run partnership for the fourth wicket along with yuvraj singh. the century, his tenth in odis, was his first in over three years. he was named as wicket keeper of the 'team of the tournament' at the 2017 champions trophy by cricbuzz. he was also named in the odi xi of the year by cricbuzz.

in august that year, during the fifth and final odi against sri lanka in colombo, he became the first wicket-keeper to effect 100 stumpings surpassing kumar sangakkara, when he stumped akila dananjaya off yuzvendra chahal. he reached the milestone of effecting 400 dismissals in odis in february 2018, following the stumping of aiden markram in the third odi of the south africa tour.

dhoni went past 10,000 odi runs in the second odi against england during his team's 2018 tour, and became the fourth indian and twelfth overall to do so. he had a relatively mediocre series, having scored 79 runs in two innings at a lowly strike rate of 63.20. this was followed by two poor outings for him in the odi format; the asia cup that he finished with 77 runs in four innings at an average of 19.25 and the home series against west indies where he aggregated 50 runs from three innings. dhoni was consequently dropped from the t20i squads for the series that followed and the australia tour later that season. however, he was included in the squad named for the odi series there. in the three-match series, dhoni found form and scored half-centuries in all three games with the latter two resulting in wins, helping india secure a 2â1 series victory, their first in a bilateral series on australian soil. dhoni finished with 193 runs and was named player of the series. he also became the fourth indian to score more than 1,000 odi runs there.

in april 2019, he was named in india's squad for the 2019 cricket world cup. in july 2019, in india's semi-final match against new zealand, dhoni played in his 350th odi.

following his good one-day performance against sri lanka, dhoni replaced dinesh karthik in december 2005 as the indian teams' test wicket-keeper. dhoni scored 30 runs in his debut match, that was marred by rain. dhoni came to the crease when the team was struggling at 109/5 and as wickets kept falling around him, he played an aggressive innings in which he was the last man to be dismissed. dhoni made his maiden half-century in the second test and his quick scoring rate (half century came off 51 balls) helped india set a target of 436 and the sri lankans were bowled out for 247.

india toured pakistan in januaryâfebruary 2006 and dhoni scored his maiden century in the second test at faisalabad. india was in a tight spot when dhoni along with irfan pathan tried to steady the ship, with the team still needing 107 runs to avoid a follow-on. dhoni played in his naturally aggressive style as he brought up his maiden test hundred in just 93 balls after scoring the first fifty in just 34 deliveries.

dhoni followed up the century with some prosaic batting performances over the next three matches, one against pakistan that india lost and two against england that had india holding a 1â0 lead. dhoni was the top scorer in india's first innings in the third test at wankhede stadium as his 64 helped india post a respectable 279 in reply to england's 400. however, dhoni and the indian fielders dropped catches and missed many dismissal chances, including a key stumping opportunity of andrew flintoff (14). dhoni failed to collect the harbhajan singh delivery cleanly as flintoff went on to make 36 more runs as england set a target of 313 for the home team, a target that india was never in danger of threatening. a batting collapse saw the team being dismissed for 100 and dhoni scored just 5 runs and faced criticism for his wicket-keeping lapses as well as his shot selection.
on the west indies tour in 2006, dhoni scored a quick and aggressive 69 in the first test at antigua. the rest of the series was unremarkable for dhoni as he scored 99 runs in the remaining 6 innings but his wicket-keeping skills improved and he finished the series with 13 catches and 4 stumpings. in the test series in south africa later that year, dhoni's scores of 34 and 47 were not sufficient to save the second test against the proteas, as india lost the series 2â1, squandering the chance to build on their first ever test victory in south africa (achieved in the first test match). dhoni's bruised hands ruled him out of the third test match.

on the fourth day of the first test match at antigua recreation ground, st john's, antigua during india's tour of west indies, 2006, dhoni's flick off dave mohammed to the midwicket region was caught by daren ganga. as the batsman started to walk back, captain dravid declared the innings when the confusion started as the umpires were not certain if the fielder stepped on the ropes and dhoni stayed for the umpire's verdict. while the replays were inconclusive, the captain of the west indies side, brian lara, wanted dhoni to walk off based on the fielder's assertion of the catch. the impasse continued for more than 15 minutes and lara's temper was on display with finger-wagging against the umpires and snatching the ball from umpire asad rauf. ultimately, dhoni walked off and dravid's declaration was effected but the game was delayed, and lara's action was criticised by the commentators and former players. lara was summoned by the match referee to give an explanation of his actions but he was not fined.

for his performances in 2007 and 2008, he was named as wicket keeper of the world test xi by cricinfo.

dhoni scored two centuries in sri lanka's tour of india in 2009, a series of three matches in which he led india to a 2â0 victory. with this feat, india soared up to the number one position in test cricket for the first time in history. india scored 726â9 (decl) in the third match of this series, which was their highest test total then. for his performances in 2009 and 2010, he was named as captain and wicket keeper of the world test xi by the icc. he was also named as wicket keeper in the world test xi by the icc in 2013.

he played his last series in the 2014â15 season in india's tour of australia captaining india in the second and third tests; losing the second and drawing the third, trailing the series 2â0 before the sydney test. following the third test in melbourne, dhoni announced his retirement from the format. in his last test, he effected nine dismissals (eight catches and a stumping), and in the process, went past kumar sangakkara in the record for stumpings with 134 (in all three formats combined). he also set a record for effecting the most dismissals in a match by an indian wicketkeeper until it was broken by wriddhiman saha in 2018. he finished his last innings unbeaten making 24 runs.

dhoni was a part of india's first ever twenty20 international match. he made debut against south africa in december 2006. he was out for a duck but india won the match. he kept the wickets and effected one catch and a runout.

on 12 february 2012, dhoni made an unbeaten 44 to guide india to their first win over australia at adelaide. in the final over, he hit a monstrous six which travelled 112 metres off the bowling of clint mckay. during the post-match presentation, he described this six as more important than the one he hit during the icc world cup final in 2011.

he was named as captain and wicket keeper of the 'team of the tournament' for the 2014 t20 world cup by the icc.

ms dhoni was chosen to lead india in first ever world t20 in 2007. he made his captaincy debut against scotland but the match was washed off. thereon, he led india to the icc world twenty 20 trophy in south africa, with a victory over arch-rivals pakistan in an intensely fought final on 24 september 2007, and became the second indian captain to have won a world cup in any form of cricket, after kapil dev. he was named as wicket keeper of the 'team of the tournament' by cricinfo for the 2007 t20i world cup.

for his performances in 2007, he was named in the world t20i xi by cricinfo. he was selected as captain and wicket keeper of the 2nd xi of the 2014 icc world t20 cup by cricinfo.

it was under his captaincy that india climbed to no. 1 in the icc test rankings in december 2009. after that, he managed to lead india in a series-levelling world championship of tests against the south africans in february 2010. india also managed to draw the test series 1â1 in south africa later that year.

after winning the 2011 icc cricket world cup final against sri lanka on 2 april 2011, with his match-winning knock of unbeaten 91, tendulkar heaped praises on dhoni, claiming him to be the best captain he has played under. tendulkar mentioned that it was dhoni's calm influence that was rubbing off on all his teammates and described dhoni's handling of pressure as incredible.

only eleven players have captained ten or more tests playing as a wicket-keeper. dhoni leads the table with 60â tests as captain, 35 ahead of mushfiqur rahim in second place.

in march 2013, dhoni became the most successful indian test captain when he eclipsed sourav ganguly's record of 21 victories from 49 tests. ganguly also said in an interview to a news channel that dhoni is the all-time greatest captain of india and he has a great record to support this credential.

in june 2013,india won 2013 icc champions trophy under dhoni's captaincy, beating england by five runs in the final, after a semi-final victory over sri lanka and defeating south africa, west indies and pakistan in the group stages.

in august 2016, dhoni was selected as captain for india's first tour to the united states, where india played two t20is against the west indies in lauderhill, florida. india lost the first match on 27 august 2016, during which dhoni surpassed former australian captain ricky ponting to become the most experienced captain in international cricket. during 2018 asia cup in india's last super four match, against afghanistan, captain rohit sharma and vice-captain shikhar dhawan were both rested for the match. he was named the captain of the side in their absence, and became the first cricketer to lead india 200 times in odis.

as captain of the indian cricket team, dhoni has seldom been suspended due to his team's slow over rate. in december 2009, he was suspended for two odi matches against sri lanka by icc match referee jeff crowe as india was three overs short of the specified rate; virender sehwag acted as captain for the two matches in cuttack and kolkata. in january 2012 dhoni was banned for the fourth test match against australia in adelaide as india was two overs short during the third test in perth. sehwag captained the team in the adelaide test and wriddhiman saha kept the wickets. in the cb series in february, dhoni again faced a one-match ban for slow-over rate against australia. 

dhoni has captained india in two world cups. under his captaincy, india won the world cup in 2011 and reached the semifinals in 2015.

dhoni played his first odi world cup in 2007 at the caribbean. india made an early exit from the tournament in the group stage. in 2007 cricket world cup, india was placed in group b with sri lanka, bangladesh and bermuda. rahul dravid captained the team in this world cup. in three matches india played, they managed to win only one against bermuda while losing the rest from bangladesh and sri lanka. in their first match against bangladesh, india was all out in just 191 in 49.3 overs. dhoni was out for 0. he stumped tamim iqbal, shakib al hasan and captain habibul bashar in the match but, india lost by 5 wickets. in the next match against bermuda, india posted the then highest score in the world cup 413/5 in a must-win match. dhoni scored 29 off 25 balls which includes two 4s and one 6. india won the match by 257 runs. india was required to win their last group match against the lankans, but they lost by 69 runs. chasing the target of 255, india crumbled to 185 all out in 43.3 overs. dhoni was dismissed for 0 for the second time in the tournament, off his very first ball by muttiah muralitharan. thus, india was out of the world cup in the very first round. the team was heavily criticized for their performance. dhoni's under construction house in ranchi was attacked by some 200 fans after the bangladesh loss.

under dhoni's captaincy, india won the 2011 world cup. in the final against sri lanka, chasing 275, dhoni promoted himself up the batting order, coming before an in-form yuvraj singh. when he came to bat, india needed more than six runs per over with three top order batsmen already dismissed. he started building a good partnership with gautam gambhir. due to good strokeplay and active running between wickets, they kept up with the required run rate. dhoni was on 60 off 60 balls but later accelerated with a greater frequency of boundaries, ending with 91 not out off 79 balls. befitting the occasion, he finished the match off in style with a huge six over long-on off bowler nuwan kulasekara and won the man of the match award. later in the post-match presentation, he admitted that he came up the order so as to counter the muralitharan spin threat, as he was very familiar with murali's bowling, who was his teammate in the indian premier league (ipl) franchise chennai super kings. he had come after the dismissal of virat kohli, also a right-handed batsman. by partnering the left-handed gambhir, he ensured a right-left combination at the crease that makes it difficult for bowlers to settle into a rhythm.

the bat used by dhoni in the final match was sold for 72 lac. the money goes to sakshi rawat foundation, operated by dhoni's wife sakshi rawat to help orphan children.

for the 2015 world cup held in australia and new zealand, dhoni was named the captain of the 30-member squad by the bcci in december 2014. under his captaincy, india was able to go through to the semi-finals with ease, beating bangladesh in the quarter-finals. however, they lost to host australia in the semi-finals held at the sydney cricket ground. the team won 7 consecutive matches in this world cup and won 11 consecutive matches overall in world cups. with the win against bangladesh, he became the first non-australian captain to win 100 odi matches, and first indian captain to achieve the mark. he is also the third captain to win 100 matches, after two australians, ricky ponting, and allan border.

dhoni was named in the 15 man squad for the 2019 cricket world cup held in england and wales. dhoni scored some handy knocks in the tournament against south africa, australia and west indies, although he was criticised for his strike rate and 'lack of intent' in the match against afghanistan and england. in the semi-final against new zealand, dhoni scored a fighting half century in the second innings but was unfortunately run out at crucial stage thus ending india's world cup run.

dhoni was contracted by the chennai super kings for us$1.5â million. this made him the most expensive player in the ipl for the first season auctions. under his captaincy, chennai super kings won the 2010 and 2011 and 2018 indian premier league titles and the 2010 and 2014 champions league t20 titles.

dhoni is a right-handed batsman and wicket-keeper. initially, dhoni appeared as a lower-order attacking batsman but he gradually changed his playing style to deal with high-pressure scenarios and his growing responsibility as a captain. he is a powerful hitter of the ball and is one of the fastest men in running between the wickets.

his wicket-keeping skill is widely praised by cricket experts. he is quickest when it comes to stumpings. he has a world record for the highest number of stumpings by any wicket-keeper. he is the main wicket-keeper in the team but he occasionally bowls as a medium fast bowler.

dhoni married sakshi singh rawat, his schoolmate in dav jawahar vidya mandir, shyamali. a native of dehradun, uttarakhand, on 4 july 2010. at the time of their marriage, she was studying hotel management and was working as a trainee at the taj bengal, kolkata. after the retirement of sakshi's father from his tea growing business, their family shifted to their native place, dehradun.

the wedding took place one day after the couple got engaged. according to bollywood actress bipasha basu, a close friend of dhoni, the wedding was planned for months and was not a spur of the moment decision. dhoni became a father on 6 february 2015 to a baby girl named ziva. at the time of her birth, dhoni was in australia as the captain of indian team with 2015 cricket world cup only a week to kick off. he decided not to travel back to india and was famously quoted saying that ""i am on national duty, other things can wait"".

as a public figure, pitt has been cited as one of the most influential and powerful people in the american entertainment industry. for a number of years he was cited as the world's most attractive man by various media outlets, and his personal life is the subject of wide publicity. in 2000, he married actress jennifer aniston; they divorced in 2005. in 2014, pitt married actress angelina jolie. they have six children together, three of whom were adopted internationally. in 2016, jolie filed for a divorce from pitt, which was finalized in 2019.

pitt was born in shawnee, oklahoma, to william alvin pitt, the proprietor of a trucking company, and jane etta (nã©e hillhouse), a school counselor. the family soon moved to springfield, missouri, where he lived together with his younger siblings, douglas mitchell (born 1966) and julie neal (born 1969). born into a conservative christian household, he was raised as southern baptist and later ""oscillate[d] between agnosticism and atheism."" pitt now states that he was just being ""rebellious"" and that he ""cling[s] to religion"". pitt has described springfield as ""mark twain country, jesse james country,"" having grown up with ""a lot of hills, a lot of lakes.""

pitt attended kickapoo high school, where he was a member of the golf, swimming and tennis teams. he participated in the school's key and forensics clubs, in school debates, and in musicals. following his graduation from high school, pitt enrolled in the university of missouri in 1982, majoring in journalism with a focus on advertising. as graduation approached, pitt did not feel ready to settle down. he loved filmsâ""a portal into different worlds for me""âand, since films were not made in missouri, he decided to go to where they were made. two weeks short of completing the coursework for a degree, pitt left the university and moved to los angeles, where he took acting lessons and worked odd jobs. he has named his early acting heroes as gary oldman, sean penn and mickey rourke.

while struggling to establish himself in los angeles, pitt took lessons from acting coach roy london. pitt's acting career began in 1987, with uncredited parts in the films ""no way out"" (1987), ""no man's land"" (1987) and ""less than zero"" (1987). in may 1987, his television debut came with a two-episode role on the nbc soap opera ""another world"". in november of the same year, pitt had a guest appearance on the abc sitcom ""growing pains"". he appeared in four episodes of the cbs primetime series ""dallas"" between december 1987 and february 1988 as randy, the boyfriend of charlie wade (played by shalane mccall). later in 1988, pitt made a guest appearance on the fox police drama ""21 jump street"". in the same year, the yugoslavianâu.s. co-production ""the dark side of the sun"" (1988) gave pitt his first leading film role, as a young american taken by his family to the adriatic to find a remedy for a skin condition. the film was shelved at the outbreak of the croatian war of independence, and was not released until 1997. pitt made two motion picture appearances in 1989: the first in a supporting role in the comedy ""happy together""; the second a featured role in the horror film ""cutting class"", the first of pitt's films to reach theaters. he made guest appearances on television series ""head of the class"", ""freddy's nightmares"", ""thirtysomething"", and (for a second time) ""growing pains"".

pitt was cast as billy canton, a drug addict who takes advantage of a young runaway (played by juliette lewis) in the 1990 nbc television movie ""too young to die?"", the story of an abused teenager sentenced to death for a murder. ken tucker, television reviewer for ""entertainment weekly"" wrote: ""pitt is a magnificent slimeball as her hoody boyfriend; looking and sounding like a malevolent john cougar mellencamp, he's really scary."" the same year, pitt co-starred in six episodes of the short-lived fox drama ""glory days"" and took a supporting role in the hbo television film ""the image"". his next appearance came in the 1991 film ""across the tracks""; pitt portrayed joe maloney, a high school runner with a criminal brother, played by rick schroder. after years of supporting roles in film and frequent television guest appearances, pitt attracted wider recognition in his supporting role in ridley scott's 1991 road film ""thelma & louise"". he played j.d., a small-time criminal who befriends thelma (geena davis). his love scene with davis has been cited as the event that defined pitt as a sex symbol. after ""thelma & louise"", pitt starred in the 1991 film ""johnny suede"", a low-budget picture about an aspiring rock star, and the 1992 live-action/animated fantasy film ""cool world"", although neither furthered his career, having poor reviews and box office performance.

pitt took the role of paul maclean in the 1992 biographical film ""a river runs through it"", directed by robert redford. his portrayal of the character was described by ""people""s janet mock as a career-making performance, proving that pitt could be more than a ""cowboy-hatted hunk."" he has admitted to feeling under pressure when making the film and thought it one of his ""weakest performancesâ ... it's so weird that it ended up being the one that i got the most attention for."" pitt believed that he benefited from working with such a talented cast and crew. he compared working with redford to playing tennis with a superior player, saying ""when you play with somebody better than you, your game gets better."" in 1993, pitt reunited with juliette lewis for the road film ""kalifornia"". he played early grayce, a serial killer and the boyfriend of lewis's character in a performance described by peter travers of ""rolling stone"" as ""outstanding, all boyish charm and then a snort that exudes pure menace."" pitt also garnered attention for a brief appearance in the cult hit ""true romance"" as a stoner named floyd, providing much needed comic relief to the action film. he capped the year by winning a showest award for male star of tomorrow.

1994 marked a significant turning point in pitt's career. starring as the vampire louis de pointe du lac in the horror film ""interview with the vampire: the vampire chronicles"", based on anne rice's 1976 novel of the same name, he was part of an ensemble cast that included tom cruise, kirsten dunst, christian slater, and antonio banderas. despite his winning two mtv movie awards at the 1995 ceremony, his performance was poorly received. according to the ""dallas observer"", ""brad pittâ [...] is a large part of the problem [in the film]. when directors play up his cocky, hunkish, folksy sideâ [...] he's a joy to watch. but there's nothing about him that suggests inner torment or even self-awareness, which makes him a boring louis."" following the release of ""interview with the vampire"", pitt starred in ""legends of the fall"" (1994), based on a novel by the same name by jim harrison, set in the american west during the first four decades of the twentieth century. portraying tristan ludlow, son of colonel william ludlow (anthony hopkins) a cornish immigrant, pitt received his first golden globe award nomination, in the best actor category. aidan quinn and henry thomas co-starred as pitt's brothers. although the film's reception was mixed, many film critics praised pitt's performance. janet maslin of ""the new york times"" said, ""pitt's diffident mix of acting and attitude works to such heartthrob perfection it's a shame the film's superficiality gets in his way."" the ""deseret news"" predicted that ""legends of the fall"" would solidify pitt's reputation as a lead actor.

in 1995, pitt starred alongside morgan freeman and gwyneth paltrow in the crime thriller ""seven"", playing a detective on the trail of a serial killer. pitt called it a great movie and declared the part would expand his acting horizons. he expressed his intent to move on from ""this 'pretty boy' thingâ [...] and play someone with flaws."" his performance was critically well received, with ""variety"" saying that it was screen acting at its best, further remarking on pitt's ability to turn in a ""determined, energetic, creditable job"" as the detective. ""seven"" earned $327â million at the international box office. following the success of ""seven"", pitt took a supporting role as jeffrey goines in terry gilliam's 1995 science-fiction film ""12 monkeys"". the movie received predominantly positive reviews, with pitt praised in particular. janet maslin of the ""new york times"" called ""twelve monkeys"" ""fierce and disturbing"" and remarked on pitt's ""startlingly frenzied performance"", concluding that he ""electrifies jeffrey with a weird magnetism that becomes important later in the film."" he won a golden globe award for best supporting actor for the film and received his first academy award nomination for best supporting actor.

the following year he had a role in the legal drama ""sleepers"" (1996), based on lorenzo carcaterra's novel of the same name. the film received mixed reviews. in the 1997 film ""the devil's own"" pitt starred, opposite harrison ford, as the irish republican army terrorist rory devany, a role for which he was required to learn an irish accent. critical opinion was divided on his accent; ""pitt finds the right tone of moral ambiguity, but at times his irish brogue is too convincingâ â it's hard to understand what he's saying"", wrote the ""san francisco chronicle."" ""the charleston gazette"" opined that it had favored pitt's accent over the movie. ""the devil's own"" grossed $140â million worldwide, but was a critical failure. later that year he led as austrian mountaineer heinrich harrer in the jean-jacques annaud film ""seven years in tibet"". pitt trained for months for the role, which demanded significant mountain climbing and trekking practice, including rock climbing in california and the european alps with his co-star david thewlis. the film received mostly negative reviews, and was generally considered a disappointment. pitt had the lead role in 1998's fantasy romance film ""meet joe black"". he portrayed a personification of death inhabiting the body of a young man to learn what it is like to be human. the film received mixed reviews, and many were critical of pitt's performance. according to mick lasalle of the ""san francisco chronicle"", pitt was unable to ""make an audience believe that he knows all the mysteries of death and eternity."" roger ebert stated ""pitt is a fine actor, but this performance is a miscalculation.""

in 1999, pitt portrayed tyler durden in ""fight club"", a film adaptation of chuck palahniuk's novel of the same name, directed by david fincher. pitt prepared for the part with lessons in boxing, taekwondo, and grappling. to look the part, pitt consented to the removal of pieces of his front teeth which were restored when filming ended. while promoting ""fight club"", pitt said that the film explored not taking one's aggressions out on someone else but to ""have an experience, take a punch more and see how you come out on the other end."" ""fight club"" premiered at the 1999 venice international film festival. despite divided critical opinion on the film as a whole, pitt's performance was widely praised. paul clinton of cnn noted the risky yet successful nature of the film, while ""variety"" remarked upon pitt's ability to be ""cool, charismatic and more dynamically physical, perhaps than [...] his breakthrough role in ""thelma and louise"""". in spite of a worse-than-expected box office performance, ""fight club"" became a cult classic after its dvd release in 2000.

pitt was cast as an irish gypsy boxer with a barely intelligible accent in guy ritchie's 2000 gangster film ""snatch"". several reviewers were critical of ""snatch""; however, most praised pitt. mick lasalle of the ""san francisco chronicle"" said pitt was ""ideally cast as an irishman whose accent is so thick even brits can't understand him"", going on to say that, before ""snatch"", pitt had been ""shackled by roles that called for brooding introspection, but recently he has found his calling in black comic outrageousness and flashy extroversion;"" while amy taubin of ""the village voice"" claimed that ""pitt gets maximum comic mileage out of a one-joke role"". the following year pitt starred opposite julia roberts in the romantic comedy ""the mexican"", a film that garnered a range of reviews but enjoyed box office success. pitt's next role, in 2001's $143â million-grossing cold war thriller ""spy game"", was as tom bishop, an operative of the cia's special activities division, mentored by robert redford's character. mark holcomb of salon.com enjoyed the film, although he noted that neither pitt nor redford provided ""much of an emotional connection for the audience"".

on november 22, 2001, pitt made a guest appearance in the eighth season of the television series ""friends"", playing a man with a grudge against rachel green, played by jennifer aniston, to whom pitt was married at the time. for this performance he was nominated for an emmy award in the category of outstanding guest actor in a comedy series. in december 2001, pitt played rusty ryan in the heist film ""ocean's eleven"", a remake of the 1960 rat pack original. he joined an ensemble cast including george clooney, matt damon, andy garcã­a, and julia roberts. well received by critics, ""ocean's eleven"" was highly successful at the box office, earning $450â million worldwide. pitt appeared in two episodes of mtv's reality series ""jackass"" in february 2002, first running through the streets of los angeles with several cast members in gorilla suits, and participating in his own staged abduction in another episode. in the same year, pitt had a cameo role in george clooney's directorial debut ""confessions of a dangerous mind"". he took on his first voice-acting roles in 2003, speaking as the titular character of the dreamworks animated film """" and playing boomhauer's brother, patch, in an episode of the animated television series ""king of the hill"".

pitt had two major film roles in 2004, starring as achilles in ""troy"", and reprising his role, rusty ryan, in the sequel ""ocean's twelve"". he spent six months sword training before the filming of ""troy"", based on the ""iliad"". an on-set injury to his achilles tendon delayed production on the picture for several weeks. stephen hunter of ""the washington post"" stated that pitt excelled at such a demanding role. ""troy"" was the first film produced by plan b entertainment, a film production company he had founded two years earlier with jennifer aniston and brad grey, ceo of paramount pictures. ""ocean's twelve"" earned $362â million worldwide, and pitt and clooney's dynamic was described by cnn's paul clinton as ""the best male chemistry since paul newman and robert redford."" in 2005, pitt starred in the doug liman-directed action comedy ""mr. & mrs. smith"", in which a bored married couple discover that each is an assassin sent to kill the other. the feature received reasonable reviews but was generally lauded for the chemistry between pitt and angelina jolie, who played his character's wife jane smith. the ""star tribune"" noted that ""while the story feels haphazard, the movie gets by on gregarious charm, galloping energy and the stars' thermonuclear screen chemistry"". ""mr. & mrs. smith"" earned $478â million worldwide, making it one of the biggest hits of 2005.

for his next film, pitt starred opposite cate blanchett in alejandro gonzã¡lez iã±ã¡rritu's multi-narrative drama ""babel"" (2006). pitt's performance was critically well-received, and the ""seattle post-intelligencer"" said that he was credible and gave the film visibility. pitt later said he regarded taking the part as one of the best decisions of his career. the film was screened at a special presentation at the 2006 cannes film festival and was later featured at the 2006 toronto international film festival.

in september 2006, pitt and jolie established a charitable organization, the jolie-pitt foundation, to aid humanitarian causes around the world. the foundation made initial donations of $1â million each to global action for children and doctors without borders, followed by an october 2006 donation of $100,000 to the daniel pearl foundation, an organization created in memory of the late american journalist daniel pearl. according to federal filings, pitt and jolie invested $8.5â million into the foundation in 2006; it gave away $2.4â million in 2006 and $3.4â million in 2007. in june 2009 the jolie-pitt foundation donated $1â million to a u.n. refugee agency to help pakistanis displaced by fighting between troops and taliban militants. in january 2010 the foundation donated $1â million to doctors without borders for emergency medical assistance to help victims of the haiti earthquake.

pitt is a supporter of same-sex marriage. in an october 2006 interview with ""esquire"", pitt said that he would marry jolie when everyone in america is legally able to marry. in september 2008, he donated $100,000 to the campaign against california's 2008 ballot proposition proposition 8, an initiative to overturn the state supreme court decision that had legalized same-sex marriage. in march 2012, pitt was featured in a performance of dustin lance black's play, ""'8'""â â a staged reenactment of the federal trial that overturned california's prop 8 ban on same-sex marriageâ â as judge vaughn walker.

in september 2012, pitt reaffirmed his support of president obama, saying, ""i am an obama supporter and i'm backing his us election campaign.""

in the late 1980s and early 1990s, pitt was involved in successive relationships with several of his co-stars, including robin givens (""head of the class""), jill schoelen (""cutting class""), and juliette lewis (""too young to die?"" and ""kalifornia""). in addition, pitt had a much-publicized romance and engagement to his ""seven"" co-star, gwyneth paltrow, whom he dated from 1994 to 1997.

pitt met ""friends"" actress jennifer aniston in 1998 and married her in a private wedding ceremony in malibu on july 29, 2000. in january 2005, pitt and aniston announced they had decided to separate. two months later, aniston filed for divorce, citing irreconcilable differences. pitt and aniston's divorce was finalized by the los angeles superior court on october 2, 2005. despite media reports that pitt and aniston had an acrimonious relationship, pitt said in a february 2009 interview that he and aniston ""check in with each other"", adding that they were both big parts of each other's lives.

during pitt's divorce proceedings, his involvement with his ""mr. & mrs. smith"" co-star angelina jolie attracted media attention. jolie and pitt stated that they ""fell in love"" on the set and that there was no infidelity. in april 2005, one month after aniston filed for divorce, a set of paparazzi photographs emerged showing pitt, jolie, and her son maddox at a beach in kenya; the press interpreted the pictures as evidence of a relationship between pitt and jolie. during 2005, the two were seen together with increasing frequency, and the entertainment media dubbed the couple ""brangelina"". on january 11, 2006, jolie confirmed to ""people"" that she was pregnant with pitt's child, thereby publicly acknowledging their relationship for the first time. pitt and jolie announced their engagement in april 2012 after seven years together. they were married on august 23, 2014, in a private ceremony in chã¢teau miraval, france. on september 19, 2016, jolie filed for divorce from pitt, citing irreconcilable differences. on april 12, 2019, the court restored jolie and pitt to single status.

in july 2005, pitt accompanied jolie to addis ababa, ethiopia, where she adopted her second child, zahara marley. on december 3, 2005, pitt was in the process of becoming the adoptive father of zahara, and jolie's first adopted child, maddox chivan. on january 19, 2006, a california judge granted jolie's request to change the children's surnames from ""jolie"" to ""jolie-pitt"". the adoptions were finalized soon after.

jolie gave birth to daughter shiloh nouvel in swakopmund, namibia, on may 27, 2006. pitt confirmed that their newborn daughter would qualify for a namibian passport. the couple sold the first pictures of shiloh through the distributor getty images; the north american rights were purchased by ""people"" for over $4.1â million, while ""hello!"" obtained the british rights for approximately $3.5â million. the proceeds from the sale were donated to charities serving african children. madame tussauds in new york unveiled a wax figure of two-month-old shiloh; it marked the first time an infant was recreated in wax by madame tussauds.

on march 15, 2007, jolie adopted three-year-old pax thien from an orphanage in ho chi minh city, vietnam. pitt adopted pax in the united states on february 21, 2008.

at the cannes film festival in may 2008, jolie confirmed that she was expecting twins. she gave birth to son knox lã©on and daughter vivienne marcheline on july 12, 2008 in nice, france. the rights for the first images of knox and vivienne were jointly sold to ""people"" and ""hello!"" for $14â millionâthe most expensive celebrity pictures ever taken. the couple donated the proceeds to the jolie-pitt foundation.

pitt has been cited as physically attractive by many sources, including ""empire"", who named him one of the 25 sexiest stars in film history in 1995. the same year, pitt was chosen as ""people""<nowiki>'</nowiki>s sexiest man alive, an accolade he received again in 2000. pitt appeared on ""forbes""<nowiki>'</nowiki>s annual celebrity 100 list of the 100 most powerful celebrities in 2006, 2007, and 2008, at no. 20, no. 5, and no. 10 respectively. in 2007, he was listed among the time 100, a compilation of the 100 most influential people in the world, as selected annually by ""time"". the magazine credited pitt with using ""his star power to get people to look [to where] cameras don't usually catch"". pitt was again included in the time 100 in 2009, this time in the builders and titans list.

starting in 2005, pitt's relationship with angelina jolie became one of the most reported celebrity stories worldwide. after confirming that jolie was pregnant in early 2006, the significant media hype surrounding the couple reached what reuters, in a story titled ""the brangelina fever,"" called ""the point of insanity"". to avoid media attention, the couple flew to namibia for the birth of their daughter shiloh, which was described by a paparazzi blog as ""the most anticipated baby since jesus christ."" similarly, intense media interest greeted the announcement two years later of jolie's second pregnancy; for the two weeks jolie spent in a seaside hospital in nice, reporters and photographers camped outside on the promenade to report on the birth.

in a 2006 global industry survey by acnielsen in 42 international markets, pitt, together with jolie, was found to be the favorite celebrity endorser for brands and products worldwide. pitt has appeared in several television commercials. for the u.s. market, he starred in a heineken commercial aired during the 2005 super bowl; it was directed by david fincher, who had directed pitt in ""seven"", ""fight club"", and ""the curious case of benjamin button"". other commercial appearances came in television spots including acura integra, in which he was featured opposite russian model tatiana sorokko, as well as softbank, and edwin jeans. on june 2, 2015, the minor planet 29132 bradpitt was named in his honor.
"
louis pasteur,"
louis pasteur (, ; december 27, 1822 â september 28, 1895) was a french biologist, microbiologist and chemist renowned for his discoveries of the principles of vaccination, microbial fermentation and pasteurization. he is remembered for his remarkable breakthroughs in the causes and prevention of diseases, and his discoveries have saved many lives ever since. he reduced mortality from puerperal fever, and created the first vaccines for rabies and anthrax.

his medical discoveries provided direct support for the germ theory of disease and its application in clinical medicine. he is best known to the general public for his invention of the technique of treating milk and wine to stop bacterial contamination, a process now called pasteurization. he is regarded as one of the three main founders of bacteriology, together with ferdinand cohn and robert koch, and is popularly known as the ""father of microbiology"".

pasteur was responsible for disproving the doctrine of spontaneous generation. he performed experiments that showed that without contamination, microorganisms could not develop. under the auspices of the french academy of sciences, he demonstrated that in sterilized and sealed flasks nothing ever developed, and in sterilized but open flasks microorganisms could grow. although pasteur was not the first to propose the germ theory, his experiments indicated its correctness and convinced most of europe that it was true.

today, he is often regarded as one of the fathers of germ theory. pasteur made significant discoveries in chemistry, most notably on the molecular basis for the asymmetry of certain crystals and racemization. early in his career, his investigation of tartaric acid resulted in the first resolution of what is now called optical isomers. his work led the way to the current understanding of a fundamental principle in the structure of organic compounds.

he was the director of the pasteur institute, established in 1887, until his death, and his body was interred in a vault beneath the institute. although pasteur made groundbreaking experiments, his reputation became associated with various controversies. historical reassessment of his notebook revealed that he practiced deception to overcome his rivals.

louis pasteur was born on december 27, 1822, in dole, jura, france, to a catholic family of a poor tanner. he was the third child of jean-joseph pasteur and jeanne-etiennette roqui. the family moved to marnoz in 1826 and then to arbois in 1827. pasteur entered primary school in 1831.

he was an average student in his early years, and not particularly academic, as his interests were fishing and sketching. he drew many pastels and portraits of his parents, friends and neighbors. pasteur attended secondary school at the collã¨ge d'arbois. in october 1838, he left for paris to join the pension barbet, but became homesick and returned in november.

in 1839, he entered the collã¨ge royal at besanã§on to study philosophy and earned his bachelor of letters degree in 1840. he was appointed a tutor at the besanã§on college while continuing a degree science course with special mathematics. he failed his first examination in 1841. he managed to pass the ""baccalaurã©at scientifique"" (general science) degree in 1842 from dijon but with a mediocre grade in chemistry.

later in 1842, pasteur took the entrance test for the ãcole normale supã©rieure. he passed the first set of tests, but because his ranking was low, pasteur decided not to continue and try again next year. he went back to the pension barbet to prepare for the test. he also attended classes at the lycã©e saint-louis and lectures of jean-baptiste dumas at the sorbonne. in 1843, he passed the test with a high ranking and entered the ãcole normale supã©rieure. in 1845 he received the ""licenciã© ã¨s sciences"" (master of science) degree. in 1846, he was appointed professor of physics at the collã¨ge de tournon (now called ) in ardã¨che, but the chemist antoine jã©rã´me balard wanted him back at the ""ãcole normale supã©rieure"" as a graduate laboratory assistant (""agrã©gã© prã©parateur""). he joined balard and simultaneously started his research in crystallography and in 1847, he submitted his two theses, one in chemistry and the other in physics.

after serving briefly as professor of physics at the dijon lycã©e in 1848, he became professor of chemistry at the university of strasbourg, where he met and courted marie laurent, daughter of the university's rector in 1849. they were married on may 29, 1849, and together had five children, only two of whom survived to adulthood; the other three died of typhoid.

pasteur was appointed professor of chemistry at the university of strasbourg in 1848, and became the chair of chemistry in 1852. in 1854, he was named dean of the new faculty of sciences at university of lille, where he began his studies on fermentation. it was on this occasion that pasteur uttered his oft-quoted remark: """"dans les champs de l'observation, le hasard ne favorise que les esprits prã©parã©s"""" (""in the field of observation, chance favors only the prepared mind"").

in 1857, he moved to paris as the director of scientific studies at the ""ãcole normale supã©rieure"" where he took control from 1858 to 1867 and introduced a series of reforms to improve the standard of scientific work. the examinations became more rigid, which led to better results, greater competition, and increased prestige. many of his decrees, however, were rigid and authoritarian, leading to two serious student revolts. during ""the bean revolt"" he decreed that a mutton stew, which students had refused to eat, would be served and eaten every monday. on another occasion he threatened to expel any student caught smoking, and 73 of the 80 students in the school resigned.

in 1863, he was appointed professor of geology, physics, and chemistry at the ""ãcole nationale supã©rieure des beaux-arts"", a position he held until his resignation in 1867. in 1867, he became the chair of organic chemistry at the sorbonne, but he later gave up the position because of poor health. in 1867, the ãcole normale's laboratory of physiological chemistry was created at pasteur's request, and he was the laboratory's director from 1867 to 1888. in paris, he established the pasteur institute in 1887, in which he was its director for the rest of his life.

in pasteur's early work as a chemist, beginning at the ""ãcole normale supã©rieure"", and continuing at strasbourg and lille, he examined the chemical, optical and crystallographic properties of a group of compounds known as tartrates.

he resolved a problem concerning the nature of tartaric acid in 1848. a solution of this compound derived from living things rotated the plane of polarization of light passing through it. the problem was that tartaric acid derived by chemical synthesis had no such effect, even though its chemical reactions were identical and its elemental composition was the same.

pasteur noticed that crystals of tartrates had small faces. then he observed that, in racemic mixtures of tartrates, half of the crystals were right-handed and half were left-handed. in solution, the right-handed compound was dextrorotatory, and the left-handed one was levorotatory. pasteur determined that optical activity related to the shape of the crystals, and that an asymmetric internal arrangement of the molecules of the compound was responsible for twisting the light. the (2r,3r)- and (2s,3s)- tartrates were isometric, non-superposable mirror images of each other. this was the first time anyone had demonstrated molecular chirality, and also the first explanation of isomerism.

some historians consider pasteur's work in this area to be his ""most profound and most original contributions to science"", and his ""greatest scientific discovery.""

pasteur was motivated to investigate fermentation while working at lille. in 1856 a local wine manufacturer, m. bigot, whose son was one of pasteur's students, sought for his advice on the problems of making beetroot alcohol and souring.

according to his son-in-law, renã© vallery-radot, in august 1857 pasteur sent a paper about lactic acid fermentation to the sociã©tã© des sciences de lille, but the paper was read three months later. a memoire was subsequently published on november 30, 1857. in the memoir, he developed his ideas stating that: ""i intend to establish that, just as there is an alcoholic ferment, the yeast of beer, which is found everywhere that sugar is decomposed into alcohol and carbonic acid, so also there is a particular ferment, a lactic yeast, always present when sugar becomes lactic acid.""

pasteur also wrote about alcoholic fermentation. it was published in full form in 1858. jã¶ns jacob berzelius and justus von liebig had proposed the theory that fermentation was caused by decomposition. pasteur demonstrated that this theory was incorrect, and that yeast was responsible for fermentation to produce alcohol from sugar. he also demonstrated that, when a different microorganism contaminated the wine, lactic acid was produced, making the wine sour. in 1861, pasteur observed that less sugar fermented per part of yeast when the yeast was exposed to air. the lower rate of fermentation aerobically became known as the pasteur effect.

pasteur's research also showed that the growth of micro-organisms was responsible for spoiling beverages, such as beer, wine and milk. with this established, he invented a process in which liquids such as milk were heated to a temperature between 60 and 100â â°c. this killed most bacteria and moulds already present within them. pasteur and claude bernard completed tests on blood and urine on april 20, 1862. pasteur patented the process, to fight the ""diseases"" of wine, in 1865. the method became known as pasteurization, and was soon applied to beer and milk.

beverage contamination led pasteur to the idea that micro-organisms infecting animals and humans cause disease. he proposed preventing the entry of micro-organisms into the human body, leading joseph lister to develop antiseptic methods in surgery.

in 1866, pasteur published ""etudes sur le vin"", about the diseases of wine, and he published ""etudes sur la biã¨re"" in 1876, concerning the diseases of beer.

in the early 19th century, agostino bassi had shown that muscardine was caused by a fungus that infected silkworms. since 1853, two diseases called ""pã©brine"" and ""flacherie"" had been infecting great numbers of silkworms in southern france, and by 1865 they were causing huge losses to farmers. in 1865, pasteur went to alã¨s and worked for five years until 1870.

silkworms with pã©brine were covered in corpuscles. in the first three years, pasteur thought that the corpuscles were a symptom of the disease. in 1870, he concluded that the corpuscles were the cause of pã©brine (it is now known that the cause is a microsporidian). pasteur also showed that the disease was hereditary. pasteur developed a system to prevent pã©brine: after the female moths laid their eggs, the moths were turned into a pulp. the pulp was examined with a microscope, and if corpuscles were observed, the eggs were destroyed. pasteur concluded that bacteria caused flacherie. the primary cause is currently thought to be viruses. the spread of flacherie could be accidental or hereditary. hygiene could be used to prevent accidental flacherie. moths whose digestive cavities did not contain the microorganisms causing flacherie were used to lay eggs, preventing hereditary flacherie.

following his fermentation experiments, pasteur demonstrated that the skin of grapes was the natural source of yeasts, and that sterilized grapes and grape juice never fermented. he drew grape juice from under the skin with sterilized needles, and also covered grapes with sterilized cloth. both experiments could not produce wine in sterilized containers.

his findings and ideas were against the prevailing notion of spontaneous generation. he received a particularly stern criticism from fã©lix archimã¨de pouchet, who was director of the rouen museum of natural history. to settle the debate between the eminent scientists, the french academy of sciences offered the alhumbert prize carrying 2,500 francs to whoever could experimentally demonstrate for or against the doctrine.

pouchet stated that air everywhere could cause spontaneous generation of living organisms in liquids. in the late 1850s, he performed experiments and claimed that they were evidence of spontaneous generation. francesco redi and lazzaro spallanzani had provided some evidence against spontaneous generation in the 17th and 18th centuries, respectively. spallanzani's experiments in 1765 suggested that air contaminated broths with bacteria. in the 1860s, pasteur repeated spallanzani's experiments, but pouchet reported a different result using a different broth.

pasteur performed several experiments to disprove spontaneous generation. he placed boiled liquid in a flask and let hot air enter the flask. then he closed the flask, and no organisms grew in it. in another experiment, when he opened flasks containing boiled liquid, dust entered the flasks, causing organisms to grow in some of them. the number of flasks in which organisms grew was lower at higher altitudes, showing that air at high altitudes contained less dust and fewer organisms. pasteur also used swan neck flasks containing a fermentable liquid. air was allowed to enter the flask via a long curving tube that made dust particles stick to it. nothing grew in the broths unless the flasks were tilted, making the liquid touch the contaminated walls of the neck. this showed that the living organisms that grew in such broths came from outside, on dust, rather than spontaneously generating within the liquid or from the action of pure air.

these were some of the most important experiments disproving the theory of spontaneous generation, for which pasteur won the alhumbert prize in 1862. he concluded that:
pasteur's later work on diseases included work on chicken cholera. he received cultures from jean joseph henri toussaint, and cultivated them in chicken broth. during this work, a culture of the responsible bacteria had spoiled and failed to induce the disease in some chickens he was infecting with the disease. upon reusing these healthy chickens, pasteur discovered he could not infect them, even with fresh bacteria; the weakened bacteria had caused the chickens to become immune to the disease, though they had caused only mild symptoms.

in 1879, his assistant, charles chamberland (of french origin), had been instructed to inoculate the chickens after pasteur went on holiday. chamberland failed to do this and went on holiday himself. on his return, the month-old cultures made the chickens unwell, but instead of the infections being fatal, as they usually were, the chickens recovered completely. chamberland assumed an error had been made, and wanted to discard the apparently faulty culture, but pasteur stopped him. he inoculated the chickens with virulent bacteria that killed other chickens, and they survived. pasteur concluded that the animals were now immune to the disease.

in december 1879, pasteur used a weakened culture of the bacteria to inoculate chickens. the chickens survived, and when he inoculated them with a virulent strain, they were immune to it. in 1880, pasteur presented his results to the french academy of sciences, saying that the bacteria were weakened by contact with oxygen.

in the 1870s, he applied this immunization method to anthrax, which affected cattle, and aroused interest in combating other diseases. pasteur cultivated bacteria from the blood of animals infected with anthrax. when he inoculated animals with the bacteria, anthrax occurred, proving that the bacteria was the cause of the disease. many cattle were dying of anthrax in ""cursed fields"". pasteur was told that sheep that died from anthrax were buried in the field. pasteur thought that earthworms might have brought the bacteria to the surface. he found anthrax bacteria in earthworms' excrement, showing that he was correct. he told the farmers not to bury dead animals in the fields.
in 1880, pasteur's rival jean-joseph-henri toussaint, a veterinary surgeon, used carbolic acid to kill anthrax bacilli and tested the vaccine on sheep. pasteur thought that this type of killed vaccine should not work because he believed that attenuated bacteria used up nutrients that the bacteria needed to grow. he thought oxidizing bacteria made them less virulent. in early 1881, pasteur discovered that growing anthrax bacilli at about 42â â°c made them unable to produce spores, and he described this method in a speech to the french academy of sciences on february 28. later in 1881, veterinarian hippolyte rossignol proposed that the sociã©tã© d'agriculture de melun organize an experiment to test pasteur's vaccine. pasteur agreed, and the experiment, conducted at pouilly-le-fort on sheep, goats and cows, was successful. pasteur did not directly disclose how he prepared the vaccines used at pouilly-le-fort. his laboratory notebooks, now in the bibliothã¨que nationale in paris, show that he actually used heat and potassium dichromate, similar to toussaint's method.

the notion of a weak form of a disease causing immunity to the virulent version was not new; this had been known for a long time for smallpox. inoculation with smallpox (variolation) was known to result in a much less severe disease, and greatly reduced mortality, in comparison with the naturally acquired disease. edward jenner had also studied vaccination using cowpox (""vaccinia"") to give cross-immunity to smallpox in the late 1790s, and by the early 1800s vaccination had spread to most of europe.

the difference between smallpox vaccination and anthrax or chicken cholera vaccination was that the latter two disease organisms had been artificially weakened, so a naturally weak form of the disease organism did not need to be found. this discovery revolutionized work in infectious diseases, and pasteur gave these artificially weakened diseases the generic name of ""vaccines"", in honour of jenner's discovery.
in 1876, robert koch had shown that ""bacillus anthracis"" caused anthrax. in his papers published between 1878 and 1880, pasteur only mentioned koch's work in a footnote. koch met pasteur at the seventh international medical congress in 1881. a few months later, koch wrote that pasteur had used impure cultures and made errors. in 1882, pasteur replied to koch in a speech, to which koch responded aggressively. koch stated that pasteur tested his vaccine on unsuitable animals and that pasteur's research was not properly scientific. in 1882, koch wrote ""on the anthrax inoculation"", in which he refuted several of pasteur's conclusions about anthrax and criticized pasteur for keeping his methods secret, jumping to conclusions, and being imprecise. in 1883, pasteur wrote that he used cultures prepared in a similar way to his successful fermentation experiments and that koch misinterpreted statistics and ignored pasteur's work on silkworms.

in 1882, pasteur sent his assistant louis thuillier to southern france because of an epizootic of swine erysipelas. thuillier identified the bacillus that caused the disease in march 1883. pasteur and thuillier increased the bacillus's virulence after passing it through pigeons. then they passed the bacillus through rabbits, weakening it and obtaining a vaccine. pasteur and thuillier incorrectly described the bacterium as a figure-eight shape. roux described the bacterium as stick-shaped in 1884.

pasteur produced the first vaccine for rabies by growing the virus in rabbits, and then weakening it by drying the affected nerve tissue. the rabies vaccine was initially created by emile roux, a french doctor and a colleague of pasteur, who had produced a killed vaccine using this method. the vaccine had been tested in 50 dogs before its first human trial. this vaccine was used on 9-year-old joseph meister, on july 6, 1885, after the boy was badly mauled by a rabid dog. this was done at some personal risk for pasteur, since he was not a licensed physician and could have faced prosecution for treating the boy. after consulting with physicians, he decided to go ahead with the treatment. over 11 days, meister received 13 inoculations, each inoculation using viruses that had been weakened for a shorter period of time. three months later he examined meister and found that he was in good health. pasteur was hailed as a hero and the legal matter was not pursued. analysis of his laboratory notebooks shows that pasteur had treated two people before his vaccination of meister. one survived but may not actually have had rabies, and the other died of rabies. pasteur began treatment of jean-baptiste jupille on october 20, 1885, and the treatment was successful. later in 1885, people, including four children from the united states, went to pasteur's laboratory to be inoculated. in 1886, he treated 350 people, of which only one developed rabies. the treatment's success laid the foundations for the manufacture of many other vaccines. the first of the pasteur institutes was also built on the basis of this achievement.

in ""the story of san michele"", axel munthe writes of some risks pasteur undertook in the rabies vaccine research:
because of his study in germs, pasteur encouraged doctors to sanitize their hands and equipment before surgery. prior to this, few doctors or their assistants practiced these procedures.

a french national hero at age 55, in 1878 pasteur discreetly told his family never to reveal his laboratory notebooks to anyone. his family obeyed, and all his documents were held and inherited in secrecy. finally, in 1964 pasteur's grandson and last surviving male descendant, pasteur valley-radot, donated the papers to the french national library (bibliothã¨que nationale de france). yet the papers were restricted for historical studies until the death of valley-radot in 1971. the documents were given a catalogue number only in 1985.

in 1995, the centennial of the death of louis pasteur, a historian of science gerald l. geison published an analysis of pasteur's private notebooks in his ""the private science of louis pasteur"", and declared that pasteur had given several misleading accounts and played deceptions in his most important discoveries. max perutz published a defense of pasteur in ""the new york review of books"". based on further examinations of pasteur's documents, french immunologist patrice debrã© concluded in his book"" louis pasteur"" (1998) that in spite of his genius, pasteur had some faults. a book review states that debrã© ""sometimes finds him unfair, combative, arrogant, unattractive in attitude, inflexible and even dogmatic"".

scientists before pasteur had studied fermentation. in the 1830s, charles cagniard-latour, friedrich traugott kã¼tzing and theodor schwann used microscopes to study yeasts and concluded that yeasts were living organisms. in 1839, justus von liebig, friedrich wã¶hler and jã¶ns jacob berzelius stated that yeast was not an organism and was produced when air acted on plant juice.

in 1855, antoine bã©champ, professor of chemistry at the university of montpellier, conducted experiments with sucrose solutions and concluded that water was the factor for fermentation. he changed his conclusion in 1858, stating that fermentation was directly related to the growth of moulds, which required air for growth. he regarded himself as the first to show the role of microorganisms in fermentation.

pasteur started his experiments in 1857 and published his findings in 1858 (april issue of ""comptes rendus chimie"", bã©champ's paper appeared in january issue). bã©champ noted that pasteur did not bring any novel idea or experiments. on the other hand, bã©champ was probably aware of pasteur's 1857 preliminary works. with both scientists claiming priority on the discovery, a dispute, extending to several areas, lasted throughout their lives.

however, bã©champ was on the losing side, as the ""bmj"" obituary remarked: his name was ""associated with bygone controversies as to priority which it would be unprofitable to recall"". bã©champ proposed the incorrect theory of microzymes. according to k. l. manchester, anti-vivisectionists and proponents of alternative medicine promoted bã©champ and microzymes, unjustifiably claiming that pasteur plagiarized bã©champ.

pasteur thought that succinic acid inverted sucrose. in 1860, marcellin berthelot isolated invertase and showed that succinic acid did not invert sucrose. pasteur believed that fermentation was only due to living cells. hans buchner discovered that zymase catalyzed fermentation, showing that fermentation was catalyzed by enzymes within cells. eduard buchner also discovered that fermentation could take place outside living cells.

pasteur publicly claimed his success in developing the anthrax vaccine in 1881. however, his admirer-turned-rival toussaint was the one who developed the first vaccine. toussaint isolated the bacteria that caused chicken cholera (later named ""pasteurella"" in honour of pasteur) in 1879 and gave samples to pasteur who used them for his own works. on july 12, 1880, toussaint presented his successful result to the french academy of sciences, using an attenuated vaccine against anthrax in dogs and sheep. pasteur on grounds of jealousy contested the discovery by publicly displaying his vaccination method at pouilly-le-fort on may 5, 1881. pasteur gave a misleading account of the preparation of the anthrax vaccine used in the experiment at pouilly-le-fort. he used potassium dichromate to prepare the vaccine. the promotional experiment was a success and helped pasteur sell his products, getting the benefits and glory.

pasteur experiments are often cited as against medical ethics, especially on his vaccination of meister. he did not have any experience in medical practice, and more importantly, lacked a medical license. this is often cited as a serious threat to his professional and personal reputation. his closest partner ãmile roux, who had medical qualifications, refused to participate in the clinical trial, likely because he considered it unjust. however, pasteur executed vaccination of the boy under the close watch of practising physicians jacques-joseph grancher, head of the paris children's hospital's paediatric clinic, and alfred vulpian, a member of the commission on rabies. he was not allowed to hold the syringe, although the inoculations were entirely under his supervision. it was grancher who was responsible for the injections, and he defended pasteur before the french national academy of medicine in the issue.

pasteur has also been criticized for keeping secrecy of his procedure and not giving proper pre-clinical trials on animals. pasteur stated that he kept his procedure secret in order to control its quality. he later disclosed his procedures to a small group of scientists. pasteur wrote that he had successfully vaccinated 50 rabid dogs before using it on meister. according to geison, pasteur's laboratory notebooks show that he had vaccinated only 11 dogs.

meister never showed any symptoms of rabies, but the vaccination has not been proved to be the reason. one source estimates the probability of meister contracting rabies at 10%.

pasteur was awarded 1,500 francs in 1853 by the pharmaceutical society for the synthesis of racemic acid. in 1856 the royal society of london presented him the rumford medal for his discovery of the nature of racemic acid and its relations to polarized light, and the copley medal in 1874 for his work on fermentation. he was elected a foreign member of the royal society (formemrs) in 1869.

the french academy of sciences awarded pasteur the 1859 montyon prize for experimental physiology in 1860, and the jecker prize in 1861 and the alhumbert prize in 1862 for his experimental refutation of spontaneous generation. though he lost elections in 1857 and 1861 for membership to the french academy of sciences, he won the 1862 election for membership to the mineralogy section. he was elected to permanent secretary of the physical science section of the academy in 1887 and held the position until 1889.

in 1873 pasteur was elected to the acadã©mie nationale de mã©decine and was made the commander in the brazilian order of the rose. in 1881 he was elected to a seat at the acadã©mie franã§aise left vacant by ãmile littrã©. pasteur received the albert medal from the royal society of arts in 1882. in 1883 he became foreign member of the royal netherlands academy of arts and sciences. on june 8, 1886, the ottoman sultan abdul hamid ii awarded pasteur with the order of the medjidie (i class) and 10000 ottoman liras. pasteur won the leeuwenhoek medal from the royal netherlands academy of arts and sciences for his contributions to microbiology in 1895.

pasteur was made a chevalier of the legion of honour in 1853, promoted to officer in 1863, to commander in 1868, to grand officer in 1878 and made a grand cross of the legion of honor in 1881.

in many localities worldwide, streets are named in his honor. for example, in the us: palo alto and irvine, california, boston and polk, florida, adjacent to the university of texas health science center at san antonio; jonquiã¨re, quã©bec; san salvador de jujuy and buenos aires (argentina), great yarmouth in norfolk, in the united kingdom, jericho and wulguru in queensland, (australia); phnom penh in cambodia; ho chi minh city; batna in algeria; bandung in indonesia, tehran in iran, near the central campus of the warsaw university in warsaw, poland; adjacent to the odessa state medical university in odessa, ukraine; milan in italy and bucharest, cluj-napoca and timièoara in romania. the avenue pasteur in saigon, vietnam, is one of the few streets in that city to retain its french name. ""avenue louis pasteur"" in the longwood medical and academic area in boston, massachusetts was named in his honor in the french manner with ""avenue"" preceding the name of the dedicatee.

both the institute pasteur and universitã© louis pasteur were named after pasteur. the schools lycã©e pasteur in neuilly-sur-seine, france, and lycã©e louis pasteur in calgary, alberta, canada, are named after him. in south africa, the louis pasteur private hospital in pretoria, and life louis pasteur private hospital, bloemfontein, are named after him. louis pasteur university hospital in koå¡ice, slovakia is also named after pasteur.

a statue of pasteur is erected at san rafael high school in san rafael, california. a bronze bust of him resides on the french campus of kaiser permanente's san francisco medical center in san francisco. the sculpture was designed by harriet g. moore and cast in 1984 by artworks foundry.

the unesco/institut pasteur medal was created on the centenary of pasteur's death, and is given every two years in his name, ""in recognition of outstanding research contributing to a beneficial impact on human health"".

after developing the rabies vaccine, pasteur proposed an institute for the vaccine. in 1887, fundraising for the pasteur institute began, with donations from many countries. the official statute was registered in 1887, stating that the institute's purposes were ""the treatment of rabies according to the method developed by m. pasteur"" and ""the study of virulent and contagious diseases"". the institute was inaugurated on november 14, 1888. he brought together scientists with various specialties. the first five departments were directed by two graduates of the ""ãcole normale supã©rieure"": ãmile duclaux (general microbiology research) and charles chamberland (microbe research applied to hygiene), as well as a biologist, ãlie metchnikoff (morphological microbe research) and two physicians, jacques-joseph grancher (rabies) and ãmile roux (technical microbe research). one year after the inauguration of the institute, roux set up the first course of microbiology ever taught in the world, then entitled ""cours de microbie technique"" (course of microbe research techniques). since 1891 the pasteur institute had been extended to different countries, and currently there are 32 institutes in 29 countries in various parts of the world.

his grandson, louis pasteur vallery-radot, wrote that pasteur had kept from his catholic background only a spiritualism without religious practice. however, catholic observers often said that pasteur remained an ardent christian throughout his whole life, and his son-in-law wrote, in a biography of him:
the ""literary digest"" of 18 october 1902 gives this statement from pasteur that he prayed while he worked:
maurice vallery-radot, grandson of the brother of the son-in-law of pasteur and outspoken catholic, also holds that pasteur fundamentally remained catholic. according to both pasteur vallery-radot and maurice vallery-radot, the following well-known quotation attributed to pasteur is apocryphal: ""the more i know, the more nearly is my faith that of the breton peasant. could i but know all i would have the faith of a breton peasant's wife"". according to maurice vallery-radot, the false quotation appeared for the first time shortly after the death of pasteur. however, despite his belief in god, it has been said that his views were that of a freethinker rather than a catholic, a spiritual more than a religious man. he was also against mixing science with religion.

in 1868, pasteur suffered a severe brain stroke that paralysed the left side of his body, but he recovered. a stroke or uremia in 1894 severely impaired his health. failing to fully recover, he died on september 28, 1895, near paris. he was given a state funeral and was buried in the cathedral of notre dame, but his remains were reinterred in the pasteur institute in paris, in a vault covered in depictions of his accomplishments in byzantine mosaics.

tom hanks,"
thomas jeffrey hanks (born july 9, 1956) is an american actor and filmmaker. hanks is known for his comedic and dramatic roles in such films as ""splash"" (1984), ""big"" (1988), ""turner & hooch"" (1989), ""a league of their own"" (1992), ""sleepless in seattle"" (1993), ""forrest gump"" (1994), ""apollo 13"" (1995), ""you've got mail"" (1998), ""the green mile"" (1999), ""cast away"" (2000), ""road to perdition"" (2002), ""cloud atlas"" (2012), ""captain phillips"" (2013), ""saving mr. banks"" (2013), and ""sully"" (2016). he has also starred in the ""robert langdon"" films, and voices sheriff woody in the ""toy story"" film series. he is one of the most popular and recognizable film stars worldwide, and is widely regarded as an american cultural icon.

hanks has collaborated with film director steven spielberg on five films to date: ""saving private ryan"" (1998), ""catch me if you can"" (2002), ""the terminal"" (2004), ""bridge of spies"" (2015), and ""the post"" (2017), as well as the 2001 miniseries ""band of brothers"", which launched hanks as a successful director, producer, and screenwriter. in 2010, spielberg and hanks were executive producers on the hbo miniseries ""the pacific"".

hanks' films have grossed more than $4.9â billion at u.s. and canadian box offices and more than $9.96â billion worldwide, making him the fifth-highest-grossing actor in north america. his awards include a golden globe award and an academy award for best actor for his role in ""philadelphia"" (1993), as well as a golden globe, an academy award, a screen actors guild award, and a people's choice award for best actor for ""forrest gump"" (1994). in 1995, hanks became one of only two actors who won the academy award for best actor in consecutive years, with spencer tracy being the other. in 2004, he received the stanley kubrick britannia award for excellence in film from the british academy of film and television arts (bafta). in 2014, he received a kennedy center honor, and in 2016, he received a presidential medal of freedom from president barack obama, as well as the french legion of honor.

thomas jeffrey hanks was born in concord, california on july 9, 1956 to hospital worker janet marylyn (""nã©e"" frager, 1932â2016) and itinerant cook amos mefford hanks (1924â1992). his mother was of portuguese descent (her family's surname was originally ""fraga""), while his father had english ancestry. his parents divorced in 1960. their three oldest children, sandra (later sandra hanks benoiton, a writer), larry (an entomology professor at the university of illinois at urbanaâchampaign), and tom, went with their father, while the youngest, jim (who also became an actor and filmmaker), remained with their mother in red bluff, california. in his childhood, hanks' family moved often; by the age of 10, he had lived in 10 different houses.

while hanks' family religious history was catholic and mormon, he has characterized his teenage self as being a ""bible-toting evangelical"" for several years. in school, he was unpopular with students and teachers alike, later telling ""rolling stone"" magazine, ""i was a geek, a spaz. i was horribly, painfully, terribly shy. at the same time, i was the guy who'd yell out funny captions during filmstrips. but i didn't get into trouble. i was always a real good kid and pretty responsible."" in 1965, his father married frances wong, a san francisco native of chinese descent. frances had three children, two of whom lived with hanks during his high school years. hanks acted in school plays, including ""south pacific"", while attending skyline high school in oakland, california.

hanks studied theater at chabot college in hayward, california, and transferred to california state university, sacramento after two years. during a 2001 interview with bob costas, hanks was asked whether he would rather have an oscar or a heisman trophy. he replied he would rather win a heisman by playing halfback for the california golden bears. he told ""new york"" magazine in 1986, ""acting classes looked like the best place for a guy who liked to make a lot of noise and be rather flamboyant. i spent a lot of time going to plays. i wouldn't take dates with me. i'd just drive to a theater, buy myself a ticket, sit in the seat and read the program, and then get into the play completely. i spent a lot of time like that, seeing brecht, tennessee williams, ibsen, and all that.""

during his years studying theater, hanks met vincent dowling, head of the great lakes theater festival in cleveland, ohio. at dowling's suggestion, hanks became an intern at the festival. his internship stretched into a three-year experience that covered most aspects of theater production, including lighting, set design, and stage management, prompting hanks to drop out of college. during the same time, hanks won the cleveland critics circle award for best actor for his 1978 performance as proteus in shakespeare's ""the two gentlemen of verona"", one of the few times he played a villain. in 2010, ""time"" magazine named hanks one of the ""top 10 college dropouts.""

in 1979, hanks moved to new york city, where he made his film debut in the low-budget slasher film ""he knows you're alone"" (1980) and landed a starring role in the television movie ""mazes and monsters"". early that year, he was cast in the lead, callimaco, in the riverside shakespeare company's production of niccolã² machiavelli's ""the mandrake"", directed by daniel southern. the following year, hanks landed one of the lead roles, that of character kip wilson, on the abc television pilot of ""bosom buddies"". he and peter scolari played a pair of young advertising men forced to dress as women so they could live in an inexpensive all-female hotel. hanks had previously partnered with scolari on the 1970s game show ""make me laugh"". after landing the role, hanks moved to los angeles. ""bosom buddies"" ran for two seasons, and, although the ratings were never strong, television critics gave the program high marks. ""the first day i saw him on the set,"" co-producer ian praiser told ""rolling stone"", ""i thought, 'too bad he won't be in television for long.' i knew he'd be a movie star in two years."" however, although praiser knew it, he was not able to convince hanks. ""the television show had come out of nowhere,"" hanks' best friend tom lizzio told ""rolling stone"".

""bosom buddies"" and a guest appearance on a 1982 episode of ""happy days"" (""a case of revenge,"" in which he played a disgruntled former classmate of fonzie) prompted director ron howard to contact hanks. howard was working on the film ""splash"" (1984), a romantic comedy fantasy about a mermaid who falls in love with a human. at first, howard considered hanks for the role of the main character's wisecracking brother, a role that eventually went to john candy. instead, hanks landed the lead role in ""splash"", which went on to become a surprise box office hit, grossing more than us$69â million. he also had a sizable hit with the sex comedy ""bachelor party"", also in 1984. in 1983â84, hanks made three guest appearances on ""family ties"" as elyse keaton's alcoholic brother, ned donnelly.

with ""nothing in common"" (1986)â â a story of a young man alienated from his father (played by jackie gleason)â â hanks began to extend himself from comedic roles to dramatic roles. in an interview with ""rolling stone"" magazine, hanks commented on his experience: ""it changed my desires about working in movies. part of it was the nature of the material, what we were trying to say. but besides that, it focused on people's relationships. the story was about a guy and his father, unlike, say, ""the money pit"", where the story is really about a guy and his house.""
after a few more flops and a moderate success with the comedy ""dragnet"", hanks' stature in the film industry rose. the broad success of the fantasy comedy ""big"" (1988) established hanks as a major hollywood talent, both as a box office draw and within the industry as an actor. for his performance in the film, hanks earned his first nomination for the academy award for best actor. ""big"" was followed later that year by ""punchline"", in which he and sally field co-starred as struggling comedians.

hanks then suffered a run of box-office underperformers: ""the 'burbs"" (1989), ""joe versus the volcano"" (1990), and ""the bonfire of the vanities"" (1990). in the last, he portrayed a greedy wall street figure who gets enmeshed in a hit-and-run accident. 1989's ""turner & hooch"" was hanks' only financially successful film of the period.

hanks climbed back to the top again with his portrayal of a washed-up baseball legend turned manager in ""a league of their own"" (1992). hanks has stated that his acting in earlier roles was not great, but that he subsequently improved. in an interview with ""vanity fair"", hanks noted his """"modern era of moviemakingâ ... because enough self-discovery has gone onâ ... my work has become less pretentiously fake and over the top"""". this ""modern era"" began in 1993 for hanks, first with ""sleepless in seattle"" and then with ""philadelphia"". the former was a blockbuster success about a widower who finds true love over the radio airwaves. richard schickel of ""time"" called his performance ""charming,"" and most critics agreed that hanks' portrayal ensured him a place among the premier romantic-comedy stars of his generation.

in ""philadelphia"", he played a gay lawyer with aids who sues his firm for discrimination. hanks lost 35 pounds and thinned his hair in order to appear sickly for the role. in a review for ""people"", leah rozen stated, ""above all, credit for ""philadelphia""s success belongs to hanks, who makes sure that he plays a character, not a saint. he is flat-out terrific, giving a deeply felt, carefully nuanced performance that deserves an oscar."" hanks won the 1993 academy award for best actor for his role in ""philadelphia"". during his acceptance speech, he revealed that his high school drama teacher rawley farnsworth and former classmate john gilkerson, two people with whom he was close, were gay.

hanks followed ""philadelphia"" with the 1994 hit ""forrest gump"" which grossed a worldwide total of over $600â million at the box office. hanks remarked: ""when i read the script for ""gump"", i saw it as one of those kind of grand, hopeful movies that the audience can go to and feelâ ... some hope for their lot and their position in lifeâ ... i got that from the movies a hundred million times when i was a kid. i still do."" hanks won his second best actor academy award for his role in ""forrest gump"", becoming only the second actor to have accomplished the feat of winning consecutive best actor oscars. (spencer tracy was the first, winning in 1937â38. hanks and tracy were the same age at the time they received their academy awards: 37 for the first and 38 for the second.)

hanks' next roleâastronaut and commander jim lovell, in the 1995 film ""apollo 13""âreunited him with ron howard. critics generally applauded the film and the performances of the entire cast, which included actors kevin bacon, bill paxton, gary sinise, ed harris, and kathleen quinlan. the movie also earned nine academy award nominations, winning two. later that year, hanks starred in disney/pixar's cgi-animated hit film ""toy story"", as the voice of sheriff woody.
hanks made his directing debut with his 1996 film ""that thing you do!"" about a 1960s pop group, also playing the role of a music producer. hanks and producer gary goetzman went on to create playtone, a record and film production company named after the record company in the film.

hanks then executive produced, co-wrote, and co-directed the hbo docudrama ""from the earth to the moon"". the 12-part series chronicled the space program from its inception, through the familiar flights of neil armstrong and jim lovell, to the personal feelings surrounding the reality of moon landings. the emmy award-winning project was, at us$68â million, one of the most expensive ventures undertaken for television.

in 1998, hanks' next project was no less expensive. for ""saving private ryan"", he teamed up with steven spielberg to make a film about a search through war-torn france after d-day to bring back a soldier. it earned the praise and respect of the film community, critics, and the general public. it was labeled one of the finest war films ever made and earned spielberg his second academy award for direction, and hanks another best actor nomination. later that year, hanks re-teamed with his ""sleepless in seattle"" co-star meg ryan for ""you've got mail"", a remake of 1940's ""the shop around the corner"". in 1999, hanks starred in an adaptation of the stephen king novel ""the green mile"". he also returned as the voice of woody in ""toy story 2"", the sequel to ""toy story"". the following year, he won a golden globe for best actor and an academy award nomination for his portrayal of a marooned fedex systems analyst in robert zemeckis's ""cast away"".

in 2001, hanks helped direct and produce the emmy-award-winning hbo miniseries ""band of brothers"". he also appeared in the september 11 television special """" and the documentary ""rescued from the closet"". he then teamed up with ""american beauty"" director sam mendes for the adaptation of max allan collins's and richard piers rayner's dc comics graphic novel ""road to perdition"", in which he played an anti-hero role as a hitman on the run with his son. that same year, hanks collaborated once again with director spielberg, starring opposite leonardo dicaprio in the hit biographical crime drama ""catch me if you can"", based on the true story of frank abagnale, jr. the same year, hanks and his wife rita wilson produced the hit movie ""my big fat greek wedding"". in august 2007, he along with co-producers rita wilson and gary goetzman, and writer and star nia vardalos, initiated a legal action against the production company gold circle films for their share of profits from the movie. at the age of 45, hanks became the youngest-ever recipient of the american film institute's life achievement award on june 12, 2002.
in 2004, he appeared in three films: the coen brothers' ""the ladykillers"", another spielberg film, ""the terminal"", and ""the polar express"", a family film from zemeckis for which hanks played multiple motion capture roles. in a ""usa weekend"" interview, hanks discussed how he chooses projects: ""[since] ""a league of their own"", it can't be just another movie for me. it has to get me going somehowâ ... there has to be some all-encompassing desire or feeling about wanting to do that particular movie. i'd like to assume that i'm willing to go down any avenue in order to do it right"". in august 2005, hanks was voted in as vice president of the academy of motion picture arts and sciences.

hanks next starred in the highly anticipated film ""the da vinci code"", based on the bestselling novel by dan brown. the film was released may 19, 2006, in the u.s. and grossed over us$750â million worldwide. he followed the film with ken burns's 2007 documentary ""the war"". for the documentary, hanks did voice work, reading excerpts from world war ii-era columns by al mcintosh. in 2006, hanks topped a 1,500-strong list of ""most trusted celebrities"" compiled by ""forbes"" magazine. hanks also produced the animated children's movie the ant bully in 2006.

cruise has been married to actresses mimi rogers, nicole kidman, and katie holmes. he has three children, two of whom were adopted during his marriage to kidman and the other of whom is a biological daughter he had with holmes. cruise is an outspoken advocate for the church of scientology and its associated social programs, and credits it with helping him overcome dyslexia. in the 2000s, he sparked controversy with his church-affiliated criticisms of psychiatry and anti-depressant drugs, his efforts to promote scientology as a religion in europe, and a leaked video interview of him promoting scientology.

cruise was born in syracuse, new york, the son of mary lee (""nã©e"" pfeiffer) (1936â2017), a special education teacher, and thomas cruise mapother iii (1934â1984), an electrical engineer, both originally from louisville, kentucky. he has three sisters: lee anne, marian, and cass. they are of english, german, and irish ancestry. one of cruise's ancestors, patrick russell cruise, was born in north county dublin in 1799; he married teresa johnson in county meath, in 1825. they left ireland for the united states that same year and settled in new york. they had a daughter, mary paulina russell cruise, whose son thomas cruise mapother was cruise's great-grandfather. a cousin, william mapother, is also an actor; he and cruise have appeared in five films together.

cruise grew up in near poverty and had a catholic upbringing. cruise described his father as ""a merchant of chaos"", a ""bully"", and a ""coward"" who inflicted beatings upon him. regarding his father, cruise once said, ""he was the kind of person where, if something goes wrong, they kick you. it was a great lesson in my lifeâhow he'd lull you in, make you feel safe and then, bang! for me, it was like, 'there's something wrong with this guy. don't trust him. be careful around him.'""

cruise spent part of his childhood in canada. his family moved to beacon hill, ottawa in late 1971 so that cruise's father could take a position as a defense consultant with the canadian armed forces. there, cruise attended the newly opened robert hopkins public school for much of grade four and grade five. in grade four, cruise first became involved in drama, under the tutelage of george steinburg. cruise and six other boys put on an improvised play to music called ""it"" at the carleton elementary school drama festival. drama organizer val wright, who was in the audience that night, reflected, ""the movement and improvisation were excellent. it was a classic ensemble piece.""

in sixth grade, cruise went to henry munro middle school in ottawa, ontario, canada. however, in the spring of that year, cruise's mother left his father, taking cruise and his sisters back to the united states; in 1978, she married jack south. cruise's father died of cancer in 1984. cruise briefly attended a franciscan seminary in cincinnati, ohio on a church scholarship and aspired to become a catholic priest before he became interested in acting. in total, cruise attended 15 schools in 14 years. in his senior year of high school, he played football for the varsity team as a linebacker, but was cut from the squad after getting caught drinking beer before a game. also in his senior year, cruise starred in his high school's production of ""guys and dolls"". he graduated from glen ridge high school in glen ridge, new jersey in 1980.

at age 18, with the blessing of his mother and stepfather, cruise moved to new york city to pursue an acting career. after working as a bus-boy in new york, cruise went to los angeles to try out for television roles. he signed with caa (creative artists agency) and began acting in films.

cruise first appeared in a bit part in the 1981 film ""endless love"", followed by a major supporting role as a crazed military academy student in ""taps"" later that year. in 1983, cruise was part of the ensemble cast of ""the outsiders"". that same year he appeared in ""all the right moves"" and ""risky business"", which has been described as ""a generation x classic, and a career-maker for tom cruise"", and which, along with 1986's ""top gun"", cemented his status as a superstar. cruise also played the male lead in the ridley scott film ""legend"", released in 1985.

cruise followed up ""top gun"" with ""the color of money"", which came out the same year, and which paired him with paul newman. 1988 saw him star in ""cocktail"", which earned him a nomination for the razzie award for worst actor. later that year he starred with dustin hoffman in ""rain man"", which won the academy award for best film and cruise the kansas city film critics circle award for best supporting actor. cruise portrayed real-life paralyzed vietnam war veteran ron kovic in 1989's ""born on the fourth of july"", which earned him a golden globe award for best actor - motion picture drama, the chicago film critics association award for best actor, the people's choice award for favorite motion picture actor, a nomination for bafta award for best actor in a leading role, and cruise's first best actor academy award nomination.

cruise's next films were ""days of thunder"" (1990) and ""far and away"" (1992), both of which co-starred then-wife nicole kidman as his love interest. in 1994, cruise starred along with brad pitt, antonio banderas and christian slater in neil jordan's ""interview with the vampire"", a gothic drama/horror film that was based on anne rice's best-selling novel. the film was well received, although rice was initially quite outspoken in her criticism of cruise having been cast in the film, as julian sands was her first choice. upon seeing the film however, she paid $7,740 for a two-page ad in ""daily variety"" praising his performance and apologizing for her previous doubts about him.

in 1996, cruise appeared as superspy ethan hunt in the reboot of """", which he produced. it was a box office success, although it received criticism regarding the jim phelps character being a villain despite being a protagonist of the original television series.

in 1996, he took on the title role in ""jerry maguire"", for which he earned a golden globe and his second nomination for an academy award. in 1999, cruise costarred with kidman in the erotic stanley kubrick film ""eyes wide shut"", and took a rare supporting role, as a motivational speaker, frank t.j. mackey, in ""magnolia"", for which he received another golden globe and nomination for an academy award.

in 2000, cruise returned as ethan hunt in the second installment of the ""mission impossible"" films, """". the film was helmed by hong kong director john woo and branded with his gun fu style, and continued the series' blockbuster success at the box office, taking in almost $547m in worldwide figures. like its predecessor, it was the highest-grossing film of the year, and had a mixed critical reception. cruise received an mtv movie award for best male performance for this film.

his next five films were major critical and commercial successes. the following year cruise starred in the romantic thriller ""vanilla sky"" (2001) with cameron diaz and penã©lope cruz. in 2002, cruise starred in the dystopian science fiction action film ""minority report"" which was directed by steven spielberg and based on the science fiction short story by philip k. dick.

in 2003, he starred in edward zwick's period action drama ""the last samurai"", for which he received a golden globe nomination for best actor. in 2004, cruise received critical acclaim for his performance as vincent in ""collateral"" - directed by michael mann.

in 2005, cruise worked again with steven spielberg in ""war of the worlds"", a loose adaptation of the h. g. wells novel of the same name, which became the fourth highest-grossing film of the year with us$591.4â million worldwide. also in 2005, he won the people's choice award for favorite male movie star, and the mtv generation award. cruise was nominated for seven saturn awards between 2002 and 2009, winning once. nine of the ten films he starred in during the decade made over $100â million at the box office.

in 2006, he returned to his role as ethan hunt in the third installment of the ""mission impossible"" film series, """". the film was more positively received by critics than the previous films in the series, and grossed nearly $400â million at the box office. in 2007, cruise took a rare supporting role for the second time in ""lions for lambs"", which was a commercial disappointment. this was followed by an unrecognizable appearance as ""les grossman"" in the 2008 comedy ""tropic thunder"" with ben stiller, jack black, and robert downey jr. this performance earned cruise a golden globe nomination. cruise played the central role in the historical thriller ""valkyrie"" released on december 25, 2008 to box office success.

in march 2010, cruise completed filming the action-comedy ""knight and day"", in which he re-teamed with former costar cameron diaz; the film was released on june 23, 2010. on february 9, 2010, cruise confirmed that he would star in """", the fourth installment in the """" series. the film was released in december 2011 to high critical acclaim and box office success. unadjusted for ticket price inflation, it was cruise's biggest commercial success to that date.

on may 6, 2011, cruise was awarded a humanitarian award from the simon wiesenthal centre and museum of tolerance for his work as a dedicated philanthropist. in mid-2011, cruise started shooting the movie ""rock of ages"", in which he played the character stacee jaxx. the film was released in june 2012.

cruise starred as jack reacher in the film adaptation of british author lee child's 2005 novel ""one shot."" the film was released on december 21, 2012. it met with positive reviews from critics and was a box office success grossing $216,568,266 worldwide. in 2013, he starred in the science fiction film ""oblivion"" based on director joseph kosinski's graphic novel of the same name. the film met with mixed reviews and grossed $285,600,588 worldwide. it also starred morgan freeman and olga kurylenko.

as of mid-2015 cruise's films have grossed about $8.2 billion worldwide.

cruise returned as ethan hunt in the fifth installment of the ""mission: impossible"" series, """", which he also produced. returning cast members included simon pegg as benji and jeremy renner as william brandt, with christopher mcquarrie as director. the film earned high critical acclaim and was a commercial success.

cruise starred in the 2017 reboot of boris karloff's 1932 horror movie ""the mummy"". the new film, also titled ""the mummy"", was produced by alex kurtzman, chris morgan, and sean daniel, written by jon spaihts and directed by kurtzman. in 2018, cruise again reprised ethan hunt, in the sixth film in his franchise, """". the film was more positively received by critics than the previous films in the series, and grossed over $791 million at the box office. unadjusted for ticket price inflation, it is cruise's biggest commercial success to date.

cruise partnered with his former talent agent paula wagner to form cruise/wagner productions in 1993, and the company has since co-produced several of cruise's films, the first being """" in 1996 which was also cruise's first project as a producer.

cruise is noted as having negotiated some of the most lucrative film deals in hollywood, and was described in 2005 by hollywood economist edward jay epstein as ""one of the most powerful â and richest â forces in hollywood."" epstein argues that cruise is one of the few producers (the others being george lucas, steven spielberg and jerry bruckheimer) who are regarded as able to guarantee the success of a billion-dollar film franchise. epstein also contends that the public obsession with cruise's tabloid controversies obscures full appreciation of cruise's exceptional commercial prowess.

cruise/wagner productions, cruise's film production company, is said to be developing a screenplay based on erik larson's ""new york times"" bestseller, ""the devil in the white city"" about a real-life serial killer, h. h. holmes, at chicago's world's columbian exposition. kathryn bigelow is attached to the project to produce and helm. meanwhile, leonardo dicaprio's production company, appian way, is also developing a film about holmes and the world's fair, in which dicaprio will star.

cruise has produced several films in which he appeared. he produced """", ""without limits"", """", ""the others"", ""vanilla sky"" and many others.

on august 22, 2006, paramount pictures announced it was ending its 14-year relationship with cruise. in the ""wall street journal"", chairman of viacom (paramount's parent company) sumner redstone cited the economic damage to cruise's value as an actor and producer from his controversial public behavior and views. cruise/wagner productions responded that paramount's announcement was a face-saving move after the production company had successfully sought alternative financing from private equity firms.

industry analysts such as edward jay epstein commented that the real reason for the split was most likely paramount's discontent over cruise/wagner's exceptionally large share of dvd sales from the ""mission: impossible"" franchise.

in november 2006, cruise and paula wagner announced that they had taken over the film studio united artists. cruise acts as a producer and star in films for united artists, while wagner serves as ua's chief executive.

production began in 2007 of ""valkyrie"", a thriller based on the july 20, 1944 assassination attempt against adolf hitler. the film was acquired in march 2007 by united artists. on march 21, 2007, cruise signed to play claus von stauffenberg, the protagonist. this project marked the second production to be greenlighted since cruise and wagner took control of united artists. the first was its inaugural film, ""lions for lambs"", directed by robert redford and starring redford, meryl streep and cruise. ""lambs"" was released on november 9, 2007, opening to unimpressive box office revenue and critical reception.

in august 2008, wagner stepped down from her position at united artists; she retains her stake in ua, which combined with cruise's share amounts to 30 percent of the studio.

cruise has homes in beverly hills, california, telluride, colorado, clearwater, florida, dulwich, london, and east grinstead, west sussex. 

in the early to mid-1980s, cruise had relationships with older women, including rebecca de mornay, three years his senior; patti scialfa, nine years his senior; and cher, 16 years his senior. cruise married actress mimi rogers on may 9, 1987. they divorced on february 4, 1990. rogers introduced cruise to the church of scientology. he met his second wife, actress nicole kidman, on the set of their film ""days of thunder"" (1990). the couple married on december 24, 1990. cruise and kidman adopted two children, isabella jane (born 1992) and connor antony (born 1995). in february 2001, cruise filed for divorce from kidman while she was unknowingly pregnant. the pregnancy ended in a miscarriage. in 2007, kidman clarified rumors of a miscarriage early in her marriage to cruise, saying in an interview, ""it was wrongly reported,"" and explaining that she had actually had an ectopic pregnancy. 
cruise was next romantically linked with penã©lope cruz, his co-star in ""vanilla sky"" (2001). their relationship ended in 2004.

an article in the october 2012 issue of ""vanity fair"" states that several sources have said that after the breakup with cruz, the church of scientology launched a secret project to find cruise a new girlfriend. according to those sources, a series of ""auditions"" of scientologist actresses resulted in a short-lived relationship with british-iranian actress nazanin boniadi, who subsequently left scientology. the church of scientology and cruise's lawyers issued strongly worded denials and threatened to sue, accusing ""vanity fair"" of ""shoddy journalism"" and ""religious bigotry."" journalist roger friedman later reported that he received an email from director and ex-scientologist paul haggis confirming the story.

in april 2005, cruise began dating actress katie holmes. on april 27 that year, cruise and holmes â dubbed ""tomkat"" by the media â made their first public appearance together in rome. a month later, cruise publicly declared his love for holmes on ""the oprah winfrey show"", jumping up and down on winfrey's couch during the show. on october 6, 2005, cruise and holmes announced they were expecting a child. in april 2006 their daughter suri was born.

on november 18, 2006, holmes and cruise were married at the 15th-century odescalchi castle in bracciano, italy, in a scientology ceremony attended by many hollywood stars. the actors' publicist said the couple had ""officialized"" their marriage in los angeles the day before the italian ceremony. there has been widespread speculation that their marriage was arranged by the church of scientology. david miscavige, the head of the church of scientology, served as cruise's best man.

on june 29, 2012, holmes filed for divorce from cruise after five and a half years of marriage. on july 9, 2012, the couple signed a divorce settlement worked out by their lawyers. because new york law requires that all divorce documents remain sealed, the exact terms of the settlement are not publicly available.

cruise is an outspoken advocate for the church of scientology and its associated social programs. he became involved with scientology in 1990 through his first wife, mimi rogers. cruise struggled with dyslexia at an early age and has said that scientology, specifically the l. ron hubbard study tech, helped him overcome dyslexia.

in addition to promoting various programs that introduce people to scientology, cruise has campaigned for scientology to be recognized as a religion in europe. in 2005, the paris city council revealed that cruise had lobbied officials nicolas sarkozy and jean-claude gaudin. they described him as a militant spokesman for scientology, and barred any further dealings with him.

cruise co-founded and raised donations for downtown medical to offer new york city 9/11 rescue workers detoxification therapy based on the works of l. ron hubbard. this drew criticism from the medical profession and from firefighters.

for such activities, scientology leader david miscavige created the scientology freedom medal of valor and awarded it to cruise in late 2004.

in january 2004, cruise made the controversial statement ""i think psychiatry should be outlawed."" further controversy erupted in 2005 after he openly criticized actress brooke shields for using the drug paxil (paroxetine), an anti-depressant to which shields attributes her recovery from postpartum depression after the birth of her first daughter in 2003. cruise asserted that there is no such thing as a chemical imbalance and that psychiatry is a form of pseudoscience. shields responded that cruise ""should stick to saving the world from aliens and let women who are experiencing postpartum depression decide what treatment options are best for them"". this led to a heated argument between matt lauer and cruise on nbc's ""today"" on june 24, 2005.

medical authorities view cruise's comments as furthering the social stigma of mental illness. shields herself called cruise's comments ""a disservice to mothers everywhere."" in late august 2006, cruise apologized in person to shields for his comments.

scientology is well known for its opposition to mainstream psychiatry and the psychoactive drugs which are routinely prescribed for treatment. it was reported that cruise's anti-psychiatry actions led to a rift with director steven spielberg. spielberg had reportedly mentioned in cruise's presence the name of a doctor friend who prescribed psychiatric medication. shortly thereafter, the doctor's office was picketed by scientologists, reportedly angering spielberg.

on january 15, 2008, a video produced by the church of scientology featuring an interview with cruise was posted on youtube, showing cruise discussing what being a scientologist means to him. the church of scientology said the video had been ""pirated and edited,"" and was taken from a three-hour video produced for members of scientology. youtube removed the cruise video from their site under threat of litigation.

after youtube investigated this claim, they found that the video did not breach copyright law, as it is covered by the fair use clause. it was subsequently reinstated on the site, and as of april 2019, the video has achieved over 13 million views. youtube has declined to remove it again, due to the popularity of the video, and subsequent changes to copyright policy of the web site.

in 2013, cruise stated that ex-wife katie holmes divorced him in part to protect the couple's daughter suri from scientology. he also said that suri is no longer a practicing member of the church.

in march 2004, his publicist of 14 years, pat kingsley, resigned. cruise's next publicist was lee anne devette, cruise's sister, who was herself a scientologist. she served in that role until november 2005. devette was replaced with paul bloch from the publicity firm rogers and cowan. such restructuring was seen as a move to curtail publicity of his views on scientology, as well as the controversy surrounding his relationship with katie holmes.

the 2015 documentary ""going clear: scientology and the prison of belief"" cast a spotlight on cruise's role in scientology. the film alleges that cruise used sea org workers as a source of free labor. in the film, cruise's former auditor marty rathbun claims that wife nicole kidman was wiretapped on tom cruise's suggestion (which cruise's lawyer denies).

in 2006, ""premiere"" ranked cruise as hollywood's most powerful actor, as cruise came in at number 13 on the magazine's 2006 power list, being the highest ranked actor. the same year, ""forbes"" magazine ranked him as the world's most powerful celebrity. the founder of cinemascore in 2016 cited cruise and leonardo dicaprio as the ""two stars, it doesn't matter how bad the film is, they can pull [the box office] up"".

in august 2006, paramount cited cruise's ""recent conduct"" as the reason they did not renew their production contract with him. in addition, marketing evaluations reported that cruise's q score (a measure of the popularity of celebrities), had fallen 40 percent.

october 10, 2006, was declared ""tom cruise day"" in japan; the japan memorial day association said that he was awarded with a special day because he has made more trips to japan than any other hollywood star.

while reviewing ""days of thunder"", film critic roger ebert noted the similarities between several of cruise's 1980s films and nicknamed the formula the ""tom cruise picture"". some of cruise's later films like ""a few good men"" and ""the last samurai"" can also be considered to be part of this formula.

""widescreenings"" noted that for tom cruise's character daniel kaffee in ""a few good men"",

[screenwriter] aaron sorkin interestingly takes the opposite approach of ""top gun"", where cruise also starred as the protagonist. in ""top gun"", cruise plays mitchell who is a 'hot shot' military underachiever who makes mistakes because he is trying to outperform his late father. where maverick mitchell needs to rein in the discipline, daniel kaffee needs to let it go, finally see what he can do.

sorkin and director rob reiner are praised in gradually unveiling kaffee's potential in the film.

during cruise's marriage to nicole kidman, the couple endured a great deal of public speculation about their sex life and rumors that cruise was gay. in 1998, he successfully sued the ""daily express"", a british tabloid which alleged that his marriage to kidman was a sham designed to cover up his homosexuality.

in may 2001, he filed a lawsuit against gay porn actor chad slater. slater had told the celebrity magazine ""actustar"" that he had been involved in an affair with cruise. this claim was strongly denied by cruise, and slater was later ordered to pay $10â million to cruise in damages after slater declared he could not afford to defend himself against the suit and would therefore default. cruise requested a default judgment and, in january 2003, a los angeles judge decided against slater after the porn actor said that his story was false.

cruise also sued ""bold magazine"" publisher michael davis for $100â million, because davis had alleged (though never confirmed) that he had video that would prove cruise was gay. the suit was dropped in exchange for a public statement by davis that the video was not of cruise, and that cruise was heterosexual.

in 2006, cruise sued cybersquatter jeff burgar to obtain control of the tomcruise.com domain name. when owned by burgar, the domain redirected to information about cruise on celebrity1000.com. the decision to turn tomcruise.com over to cruise was handed down by the world intellectual property organization (wipo) on july 5, 2006.

in 2009, michael davis sapir filed a suit charging that his phone had been wiretapped at cruise's behest. that suit was dismissed by a central civil west court judge in los angeles on the grounds that the statute of limitations had expired on sapir's claim.

in october 2012, cruise filed a lawsuit against ""in touch"" and ""life & style"" magazines for defamation after they claimed cruise had ""abandoned"" his six-year-old daughter. during deposition, cruise testified that due to his work load 110 days had passed without him seeing her. the suit was ultimately settled between the two parties.

will smith,"
willard carroll smith jr. (born september 25, 1968) is an american actor, rapper and media personality. in april 2007, ""newsweek"" called him ""the most powerful actor in hollywood"". smith has been nominated for five golden globe awards and two academy awards, and has won four grammy awards.

in the late 1980s, smith achieved modest fame as a rapper under the name the fresh prince. in 1990, his popularity increased dramatically when he starred in the nbc television series ""the fresh prince of bel-air"", which ran for six seasons until 1996. after the series ended, smith transitioned from television to film and went on to star in numerous blockbuster films. he is the only actor to have eight consecutive films gross over $100â million in the domestic box office, eleven consecutive films gross over $150â million internationally, and eight consecutive films in which he starred open at the number one spot in the domestic box office tally.

smith has been ranked as the most bankable star worldwide by ""forbes"". as of 2014, 17 of the 21 films in which he has had leading roles have accumulated worldwide gross earnings of over $100â million each, with five taking in over $500â million each in global box office receipts. as of 2016, his films have grossed $7.5â billion at the global box office.
for his performances as boxer muhammad ali in ""ali"" (2001) and stockbroker chris gardner in ""the pursuit of happyness"" (2006), smith received nominations for the academy award for best actor.

smith was born on september 25, 1968 in philadelphia, pennsylvania to caroline ( bright), a philadelphia school board administrator, and willard carroll smith sr., a u.s. air force veteran and refrigeration engineer. he grew up in west philadelphia's wynnefield neighborhood, and was raised baptist. he has an elder sister named pamela and two younger siblings, twins harry and ellen. smith attended our lady of lourdes, a private catholic elementary school in philadelphia. his parents separated when he was 13, but did not actually divorce until around 2000.

smith attended overbrook high school. while it has been widely reported that smith turned down a scholarship to attend the massachusetts institute of technology (mit), he never applied to college because he ""wanted to rap."" smith says he was admitted to a ""pre-engineering [summer] program"" at mit for high school students, but he did not attend. according to smith, ""my mother, who worked for the school board of philadelphia, had a friend who was the admissions officer at mit. i had pretty high sat scores and they needed black kids, so i probably could have gotten in. but i had no intention of going to college.""

smith started as the mc of the hip-hop duo dj jazzy jeff & the fresh prince, with his childhood friend jeffrey ""dj jazzy jeff"" townes as turntablist and producer. townes and smith were introduced to each other by chance in 1985, as townes was performing at a house party only a few doors down from smith's residence, and he was missing his hype man. smith decided to fill in. they both felt strong chemistry, and townes was upset when his hype man finally made it to the party.

soon after, the two decided to join forces. smith enlisted a friend to join as the beatboxer of the group, clarence holmes (ready rock c), making them a trio. philadelphia-based word up records released their first single in late 1985 to 1986 when a&r man paul oakenfold introduced them to word up with their single ""girls ain't nothing but trouble,"" a tale of funny misadventures that landed smith and his former dj and rap partner mark forrest (lord supreme) in trouble. the song sampled the theme song of ""i dream of jeannie."" smith became known for light-hearted story-telling raps and capable, though profanity-free, ""battle"" rhymes. the single became a hit a month before smith graduated from high school.

based on this success, the duo were brought to the attention of jive records and russell simmons. the duo's first album, ""rock the house"", which was first released on word up in 1986 debuted on jive in march 1987. the group received the first grammy award for best rap performance in 1989 for ""parents just don't understand"" (1988), though their most successful single was ""summertime"" (1991), which earned the group their second grammy and peaked at number 4 on the ""billboard"" hot 100. smith and townes are still friends and claim that they never split up, having made songs under smith's solo performer credit.

smith spent money freely around 1988 and 1989 and underpaid his income taxes. the internal revenue service eventually assessed a $2.8â million tax debt against smith, took many of his possessions, and garnished his income.
smith was struggling financially in 1990, when the nbc television network signed him to a contract and built a sitcom, ""the fresh prince of bel-air"", around him. the show was successful and began his acting career. smith set for himself the goal of becoming ""the biggest movie star in the world"", studying box office successes' common characteristics.

in 1989, smith was arrested in relation to an alleged assault on his record promoter, william hendricks, but all charges were dismissed.

smith's first major roles were in the drama ""six degrees of separation"" (1993) and the action film ""bad boys"" (1995) in which he starred opposite martin lawrence. the latter film was commercially successful, grossing $141,407,024 worldwide â $65,807,024 in north america and $75,600,000 overseas. however, critical reception was generally mixed. in 1996, smith starred as part of an ensemble cast in roland emmerich's ""independence day"". the film was a massive blockbuster, becoming the second highest-grossing film in history at the time and establishing smith as a prime box office draw.

in the summer of 1997, he starred alongside tommy lee jones in the hit ""men in black"", playing agent j. the film was released on july 2 by columbia pictures, and grossed over $589.3â million worldwide against a $90â million budget, becoming the year's third highest-grossing film, with an estimated 54,616,700 tickets sold in the us. it received worldwide acclaim, with critics highly praising its humor, as well as jones and smith's performances.

during the summer of 1997, smith also began his solo music career with the release of ""men in black"", the theme song for the film, which topped singles charts in several regions across the world, including the uk. ""men in black"" (and second single ""just cruisin'"") was later included on smith's debut solo album ""big willie style"", which reached the top ten of the us ""billboard"" 200 and was certified nine times platinum by the recording industry association of america (riaa). the third single from the album, ""gettin' jiggy wit it"", became smith's first ""billboard"" hot 100 number one when it was released in 1998.

in 1998, smith starred with gene hackman in ""enemy of the state"". the following year he turned down the role of neo in ""the matrix"" in favor of ""wild wild west"" (1999). despite the disappointment of ""wild wild west"", smith has said that he harbors no regrets about his decision, asserting that keanu reeves's performance as neo was superior to what smith himself would have achieved, although in interviews subsequent to the release of ""wild wild west"" he stated that he ""made a mistake on ""wild wild west"". that could have been better.""

smith's second album was again supported by the release of a film theme song as the lead single: ""wild wild west"", featuring dru hill and kool moe dee, topped the ""billboard"" hot 100 and was certified gold by the riaa. the album in question, ""willennium"", reached number five on the ""billboard"" 200 and was certified double platinum by the riaa. ""will 2k"", the second single from the album, reached number 25 on the ""billboard"" hot 100. before the end of 1999, a video album was released featuring smith's seven music videos released to date, which reached number 25 on the uk music video chart. the same year, the rapper was also featured on ""the fresh prince of bel-air"" co-star tatyana ali's single ""boy you knock me out"", which reached number three on the uk singles chart and topped the uk r&b singles chart.

smith portrayed heavyweight boxer muhammad ali in the 2001 biopic ""ali"". for his performance he was nominated for the academy award for best actor, and the golden globe award for best actorâ â motion picture drama.
in 2002, following a four-year musical hiatus, smith returned with his third album ""born to reign"", which reached number 13 on the ""billboard"" 200 and was certified gold by the riaa. the album's lead single was the theme song from smith's film ""men in black ii"", called ""black suits comin' (nod ya head)"", which reached number three on the uk singles chart. later in the year, smith's first compilation album ""greatest hits"" was released, featuring songs from his three solo albums as well as those produced with dj jazzy jeff.

2003 saw smith return for ""bad boys ii"", the sequel to the 1995 film ""bad boys""; the film follows detectives burnett and lowrey investigating the flow of ecstasy into miami. despite receiving generally negative reviews, the film was a box office success, grossing $270â million worldwide.

smith's latest album ""lost and found"" was released in 2005, peaking at number six on the ""billboard"" 200. lead single ""switch"" reached the top ten of both the ""billboard"" hot 100 and the uk singles chart. in 2005, smith was entered into the ""guinness book of world records"" for attending three premieres in a 24-hour time span.

smith and his son jaden played father and son in the 2006 biographical drama ""the pursuit of happyness"" in the film smith portrays chris gardner. smith first became interested in making a film about gardner after seeing him on ""20/20"" and connected with him during production. the film, along with smith's performance, received praise.

on december 10, 2007, smith was honored at grauman's chinese theatre on hollywood boulevard. smith left an imprint of his hands and feet outside the theater in front of many fans. later that month, smith starred in the film ""i am legend"", released december 14, 2007. alongside marginally positive reviews, its opening was the largest ever for a film released in the united states during december. smith himself has said that he considers the film to be ""aggressively unique"". a reviewer said that the film's commercial success ""cemented [smith's] standing as the number one box office draw in hollywood."" on december 1, 2008, ""tv guide"" reported that smith was selected as one of america's top ten most fascinating people of 2008 for a barbara walters abc special that aired on december 4, 2008.

in 2008, smith was reported to be developing a film entitled ""the last pharaoh"", in which he would be starring as taharqa. smith later starred in the superhero movie ""hancock"", which grossed $227,946,274 in the united states and canada and had a worldwide total of $624,386,746.

on august 19, 2011, it was announced that smith had returned to the studio with producer la mar edwards to work on his fifth studio album.

smith again reprised his role as agent j with ""men in black 3"", which opened on may 25, 2012, his first major starring role in four years. after the release of the film, smith was content with ending his work with the franchise, saying, ""i think three is enough for me. three of anything is enough for me. we'll look at it and we'll consider it, but it feels like that it might be time to let someone else do that."" ""men in black 3"", released ten years after ""men in black ii"" (2002), grossed over $624â million worldwide. unadjusted for inflation, it is the highest-grossing film in the series.

in 2013, smith starred in ""after earth"" with his son jaden. the film was a disappointment at the domestic box office and was panned critically. calling the film ""the most painful failure in my career"", smith ended up taking a year and a half break as a result.

smith starred opposite margot robbie in the romance drama ""focus"". he played nicky spurgeon, a veteran con artist who takes a young, attractive woman under his wing. ""focus"" was released on february 27, 2015. smith was set to star in the sci-fi thriller ""brilliance"", an adaptation of marcus sakey's novel of the same name scripted by ""jurassic park"" writer david koepp, but he left the project to work on the ridley scott-produced sports drama ""concussion"".

in ""concussion"", smith played dr. bennet omalu of the brain injury research institute, the first to discover chronic traumatic encephalopathy. smith reported he had doubts about the film early in the production, saying, ""some of my happiest memories are of watching my son catch and throw a football. i didn't want to be the guy who did a movie saying football could be dangerous."" these views subsided when he met omalu, whose words about american ideals resonated with smith. smith's performance was praised for being ""sensitive [and] understated"".

in 2016, smith played deadshot in the supervillain team-up action film ""suicide squad"". smith's participation in the film meant choosing it over a role in """", which he said would be like ""clinging and clawing backwards."" later that year, smith starred in director david frankel's drama ""collateral beauty"", playing a new york advertising executive who succumbs to a deep depression after a personal tragedy. weeks after signing smith onto the film, his father was diagnosed with cancer, from which he died in 2016. as part of his role required him to read about religion and the afterlife, he was brought closer to the elder smith, calling the experience ""a beautiful way to prepare for a movie and an even more majestic way to say goodbye to my father.""
his film, ""bright"" was distributed via netflix on december 22, 2017. an urban fantasy, it was the most expensive film for netflix to date. smith collaborated with his director from ""suicide squad"", david ayer. that month, smith launched his own youtube channel, which as of july 2019 has over 6 million subscribers and 294 million total views. also in 2017, smith released the song ""get lit"" a collaboration between him and his former group mate jazzy jeff.

smith performed the official song ""live it up"" alongside american singer nicky jam and kosovar singer era istrefi at the closing ceremony of the 2018 fifa world cup in moscow, russia. that september smith appeared, alongside, bad bunny, on the marc anthony song estã¡ rico.

smith portrayed the genie (originally played by robin williams) in the live-action adaptation of disney's ""aladdin"", directed by guy ritchie. he also participated in the soundtracks by recording singles: ""arabian nights (2019)"", ""friend like me"" and ""prince ali"". the film was released on may 24, 2019. ""aladdin"" grossed over $1â billion worldwide to become smith's highest-grossing film, surpassing ""independence day"". smith was also featured on rapper logic's song ""don't be afraid to be different"" (2019), from his fifth studio album ""confessions of a dangerous mind"".

smith appeared as an assassin who faces off against a younger clone of himself in ang lee's ""gemini man"", released on october 11, 2019. smith voices spy lance sterling in ""spies in disguise"", where he teams up with the nerdy inventor who creates his gadgets, voiced by tom holland. the film is scheduled to be released on december 25, 2019.

smith married sheree zampino in 1992. their son willard carroll ""trey"" smith iii was born on november 11, 1992.

smith married actress jada koren pinkett in 1997. together they have two children: jaden christopher syre smith (born 1998), his co-star in ""the pursuit of happyness"" and ""after earth""; and willow camille reign smith (born 2000), who appeared as his daughter in ""i am legend"". smith and his brother harry own treyball development inc., a beverly hills-based company named after trey. smith and his family reside in los angeles, california.

smith was raised in a baptist household and attended a catholic school. in a 2013 interview, he did not identify as religious; however, in 2015 smith said in an interview with ""the christian post"" that his christian faith, which was instilled in him by his grandmother, helped him to accurately portray his role as bennet omalu in ""concussion"" saying, ""she was my spiritual teacher, she was that grandmother at the church, the one having the kids doing the easter presentations and putting on the christmas plays and her kids and grandkids had to be first. she was the most spiritually certain person that i had ever met in my entire life. even to the point that when she was dying she was happy, like she was really excited about going to heaven."" he is not a scientologist and has denied rumors claiming him as a member of the church of scientology, but he has spoken favorably about it: ""i just think a lot of the ideas in scientology are brilliant and revolutionary and non-religious.""

smith gave $1.3â million to charities in 2007, of which $450,000 went to two christian ministries, and $122,500 went to three scientology organizations; the remaining beneficiaries included ""a los angeles mosque, other christian-based schools and churches, and ... the yitzhak rabin memorial center in israel."" smith and his wife have also founded a private elementary school in calabasas, california, the new village leadership academy. federal tax filing showed that smith donated $1.2â million to the school in 2010.

in 2018, smith performed the hindu rite of abhisheka of lord shiva at haridwar, india. he also performed an aarti of the holy river ganga. he said that he felt a deep connection with hindu spirituality and indian astrology.

smith donated $4,600 to the 2008 presidential campaign of democrat barack obama. on december 11, 2009, smith and his wife hosted the nobel peace prize concert in oslo, norway to celebrate obama's winning of the prize.

in 2012, smith stated he supported legalizing same-sex marriage.

in 2018, smith celebrated his 50th birthday by performing a bungee jump from a helicopter in the grand canyon. smith was insured by lloyd's of london for $200â million for the jump which raised money for the charity global citizen.
"
ernest rutherford,"
ernest rutherford, 1st baron rutherford of nelson, , hfrse (30 august 1871â â 19 october 1937), was a new zealand-born british physicist who came to be known as the father of nuclear physics. ""encyclopã¦dia britannica"" considers him to be the greatest experimentalist since michael faraday (1791â1867).

in early work, rutherford discovered the concept of radioactive half-life, the radioactive element radon, and differentiated and named alpha and beta radiation. this work was performed at mcgill university in montreal, canada. it is the basis for the nobel prize in chemistry he was awarded in 1908 ""for his investigations into the disintegration of the elements, and the chemistry of radioactive substances"", for which he was the first canadian and oceanian nobel laureate.

rutherford moved in 1907 to the victoria university of manchester (today university of manchester) in the uk, where he and thomas royds proved that alpha radiation is helium nuclei. rutherford performed his most famous work after he became a nobel laureate. in 1911, although he could not prove that it was positive or negative,
he theorized that atoms have their charge concentrated in a very small nucleus,
and thereby pioneered the rutherford model of the atom, through his discovery and interpretation of rutherford scattering by the gold foil experiment of hans geiger and ernest marsden. he performed the first artificially induced nuclear reaction in 1917 in experiments where nitrogen nuclei were bombarded with alpha particles. as a result, he discovered the emission of a subatomic particle which, in 1919, he called the ""hydrogen atom"" but, in 1920, he more accurately named the proton. 

rutherford became director of the cavendish laboratory at the university of cambridge in 1919. under his leadership the neutron was discovered by james chadwick in 1932 and in the same year the first experiment to split the nucleus in a fully controlled manner was performed by students working under his direction, john cockcroft and ernest walton. after his death in 1937, he was honoured by being interred with the greatest scientists of the united kingdom, near sir isaac newton's tomb in westminster abbey. the chemical element rutherfordium (element 104) was named after him in 1997.

ernest rutherford was the son of james rutherford, a farmer, and his wife martha thompson, originally from hornchurch, essex, england. james had emigrated to new zealand from perth, scotland, ""to raise a little flax and a lot of children"". ernest was born at brightwater, near nelson, new zealand. his first name was mistakenly spelled 'earnest' when his birth was registered. rutherford's mother martha thompson was a schoolteacher.

he studied at havelock school and then nelson college and won a scholarship to study at canterbury college, university of new zealand, where he participated in the debating society and played rugby. after gaining his ba, ma and bsc, and doing two years of research during which he invented a new form of radio receiver, in 1895 rutherford was awarded an 1851 research fellowship from the royal commission for the exhibition of 1851, to travel to england for postgraduate study at the cavendish laboratory, university of cambridge. he was among the first of the 'aliens' (those without a cambridge degree) allowed to do research at the university, under the leadership of j. j. thomson, which aroused jealousies from the more conservative members of the cavendish fraternity. with thomson's encouragement, he managed to detect radio waves at half a mile and briefly held the world record for the distance over which electromagnetic waves could be detected, though when he presented his results at the british association meeting in 1896, he discovered he had been outdone by another lecturer, by the name of guglielmo marconi.

in 1898, thomson recommended rutherford for a position at mcgill university in montreal, canada. he was to replace hugh longbourne callendar who held the chair of macdonald professor of physics and was coming to cambridge. rutherford was accepted, which meant that in 1900 he could marry mary georgina newton (1876â1954) to whom he had become engaged before leaving new zealand; they married at st paul's anglican church, papanui in christchurch, they had one daughter, eileen mary (1901â1930), who married ralph fowler. in 1901, he gained a dsc from the university of new zealand. in 1907, rutherford returned to britain to take the chair of physics at the victoria university of manchester.

he was knighted in 1914. during world war i, he worked on a top secret project to solve the practical problems of submarine detection by sonar. in 1916, he was awarded the hector memorial medal. in 1919, he returned to the cavendish succeeding j. j. thomson as the cavendish professor and director. under him, nobel prizes were awarded to james chadwick for discovering the neutron (in 1932), john cockcroft and ernest walton for an experiment which was to be known as ""splitting the atom"" using a particle accelerator, and edward appleton for demonstrating the existence of the ionosphere. in 1925, rutherford pushed calls to the government of new zealand to support education and research, which led to the formation of the department of scientific and industrial research (dsir) in the following year. between 1925 and 1930, he served as president of the royal society, and later as president of the academic assistance council which helped almost 1,000 university refugees from germany. he was appointed to the order of merit in the 1925 new year honours and raised to the peerage as baron rutherford of nelson, of cambridge in the county of cambridge in 1931, a title that became extinct upon his unexpected death in 1937. in 1933, rutherford was one of the two inaugural recipients of the t. k. sidey medal, set up by the royal society of new zealand as an award for outstanding scientific research.
for some time before his death, rutherford had a small hernia, which he had neglected to have fixed, and it became strangulated, causing him to be violently ill. despite an emergency operation in london, he died four days afterwards of what physicians termed ""intestinal paralysis"", at cambridge. after cremation at golders green crematorium, he was given the high honour of burial in westminster abbey, near isaac newton and other illustrious british scientists.

at cambridge, rutherford started to work with j. j. thomson on the conductive effects of x-rays on gases, work which led to the discovery of the electron which thomson presented to the world in 1897. hearing of becquerel's experience with uranium, rutherford started to explore its radioactivity, discovering two types that differed from x-rays in their penetrating power. continuing his research in canada, he coined the terms alpha ray and beta ray in 1899 to describe the two distinct types of radiation. he then discovered that thorium gave off a gas which produced an emanation which was itself radioactive and would coat other substances. he found that a sample of this radioactive material of any size invariably took the same amount of time for half the sample to decay â its ""half-life"" (11â½ minutes in this case).

from 1900 to 1903, he was joined at mcgill by the young chemist frederick soddy (nobel prize in chemistry, 1921) for whom he set the problem of identifying the thorium emanations. once he had eliminated all the normal chemical reactions, soddy suggested that it must be one of the inert gases, which they named thoron (later found to be an isotope of radon). they also found another type of thorium they called thorium x, and kept on finding traces of helium. they also worked with samples of ""uranium x"" from william crookes and radium from marie curie.

in 1903, they published their ""law of radioactive change,"" to account for all their experiments. until then, atoms were assumed to be the indestructible basis of all matter and although curie had suggested that radioactivity was an atomic phenomenon, the idea of the atoms of radioactive substances breaking up was a radically new idea. rutherford and soddy demonstrated that radioactivity involved the spontaneous disintegration of atoms into other, as yet, unidentified matter. the nobel prize in chemistry 1908 was awarded to ernest rutherford ""for his investigations into the disintegration of the elements, and the chemistry of radioactive substances"".

in 1903, rutherford considered a type of radiation discovered (but not named) by french chemist paul villard in 1900, as an emission from radium, and realised that this observation must represent something different from his own alpha and beta rays, due to its very much greater penetrating power. rutherford therefore gave this third type of radiation the name of gamma ray. all three of rutherford's terms are in standard use today â other types of radioactive decay have since been discovered, but rutherford's three types are among the most common.

in manchester, he continued to work with alpha radiation. in conjunction with hans geiger, he developed zinc sulfide scintillation screens and ionisation chambers to count alphas. by dividing the total charge they produced by the number counted, rutherford decided that the charge on the alpha was two. in late 1907, ernest rutherford and thomas royds allowed alphas to penetrate a very thin window into an evacuated tube. as they sparked the tube into discharge, the spectrum obtained from it changed, as the alphas accumulated in the tube. eventually, the clear spectrum of helium gas appeared, proving that alphas were at least ionised helium atoms, and probably helium nuclei.

a long-standing myth existed, at least as early as 1948, running at least to 2017, that rutherford was the first scientist to observe and report an artificial transmutation of a stable element into another element: nitrogen into oxygen. it was thought by many people to be one of rutherford's greatest accomplishments. the new zealand government even commemorated a stamp in honor of its belief that that the nitrogen-to-oxygen discovery belonged to rutherford. beginning in 2017, many scientific institutions corrected their versions of this history to indicate that the discovery credit for the reaction belongs to patrick blackett. rutherford did detect the ejected proton in 1919 and interpreted it as evidence for disintegration of the nitrogen nucleus (to lighter nuclei). however, in 1925 blackett showed that the actual product is oxygen and identified the true reaction as n + î± â o + p. rutherford therefore recognized ""that the nucleus may increase rather than diminish in mass as the result of collisions in which the proton is expelled.""

rutherford performed his most famous work ""after"" receiving the nobel prize in 1908. along with hans geiger and ernest marsden in 1909, he carried out the geigerâmarsden experiment, which demonstrated the nuclear nature of atoms by deflecting alpha particles passing through a thin gold foil. rutherford was inspired to ask geiger and marsden in this experiment to look for alpha particles with very high deflection angles, of a type not expected from any theory of matter at that time. such deflections, though rare, were found, and proved to be a smooth but high-order function of the deflection angle. it was rutherford's interpretation of this data that led him to formulate the rutherford model of the atom in 1911that a very small charged nucleus, containing much of the atom's mass, was orbited by low-mass electrons.

in 1919â1920, rutherford found that nitrogen and other light elements ejected a proton (rutherford said ""a hydrogen atom"" rather than ""a proton"") when hit with î± (alpha) particles. this result showed rutherford that hydrogen nuclei were a part of nitrogen nuclei (and by inference, probably other nuclei as well). such a construction had been suspected for many years on the basis of atomic weights which were whole numbers of that of hydrogen; see prout's hypothesis. hydrogen was known to be the lightest element, and its nuclei presumably the lightest nuclei. now, because of all these considerations, rutherford decided that a hydrogen nucleus was possibly a fundamental building block of all nuclei, and also possibly a new fundamental particle as well, since nothing was known from the nucleus that was lighter. thus, confirming and extending the work of wilhelm wien who in 1898 discovered the proton in streams of ionized gas, rutherford postulated the hydrogen nucleus to be a new particle in 1920, which he dubbed the ""proton"".

in 1921, while working with niels bohr (who postulated that electrons moved in specific orbits), rutherford theorized about the existence of neutrons, (which he had christened in his 1920 bakerian lecture), which could somehow compensate for the repelling effect of the positive charges of protons by causing an attractive nuclear force and thus keep the nuclei from flying apart from the repulsion between protons. the only alternative to neutrons was the existence of ""nuclear electrons"" which would counteract some of the proton charges in the nucleus, since by then it was known that nuclei had about twice the mass that could be accounted for if they were simply assembled from hydrogen nuclei (protons). but how these nuclear electrons could be trapped in the nucleus, was a mystery.

rutherford's theory of neutrons was proved in 1932 by his associate james chadwick, who recognized neutrons immediately when they were produced by other scientists and later himself, in bombarding beryllium with alpha particles. in 1935, chadwick was awarded the nobel prize in physics for this discovery.

rutherford is considered to have been among the greatest scientists in history. at the opening session of the 1938 indian science congress, which rutherford had been expected to preside over before his death, astrophysicist james jeans spoke in his place and deemed him ""one of the greatest scientists of all time,"" saying: 

rutherford's research, and work done under him as laboratory director, established the nuclear structure of the atom and the essential nature of radioactive decay as a nuclear process. patrick blackett, a research fellow working under rutherford, using natural alpha particles, demonstrated ""induced"" nuclear transmutation. rutherford's team later, using protons from an accelerator, demonstrated ""artificially-induced"" nuclear reactions and transmutation. he is known as the father of nuclear physics. rutherford died too early to see leã³ szilã¡rd's idea of controlled nuclear chain reactions come into being. however, a speech of rutherford's about his artificially-induced transmutation in lithium, printed in 12 september 1933 london paper ""the times"", was reported by szilã¡rd to have been his inspiration for thinking of the possibility of a controlled energy-producing nuclear chain reaction. szilard had this idea while walking in london, on the same day.

rutherford's speech touched on the 1932 work of his students john cockcroft and ernest walton in ""splitting"" lithium into alpha particles by bombardment with protons from a particle accelerator they had constructed. rutherford realized that the energy released from the split lithium atoms was enormous, but he also realized that the energy needed for the accelerator, and its essential inefficiency in splitting atoms in this fashion, made the project an impossibility as a practical source of energy (accelerator-induced fission of light elements remains too inefficient to be used in this way, even today). rutherford's speech in part, read:



the coupland building at manchester university, at which rutherford conducted many of his experiments, has been the subject of a cancer cluster investigation. there has been a statistically high incidence of pancreatic cancer, brain cancer, and motor neuron disease occurring in and around rutherford's former laboratories and, since 1984, a total of six workers have been stricken with these ailments. in 2009, an independent commission concluded that the very slightly elevated levels of various radiation related to rutherford's experiments decades earlier are not the likely cause of such cancers and ruled the illnesses a coincidence.
